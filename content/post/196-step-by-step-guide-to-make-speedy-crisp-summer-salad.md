recipeinstructions:
- "The nuts take the longest since they have to roast in the oven, so they are prepared first. Set the oven to 350°, then prepare a baking sheet with some parchment paper and scatter the nuts evenly across it. The oil is then drizzled on top and stirred until it&#39;s coated evenly. Let them roast for 10-15 mins and stir them occasionally until evenly roasted."
- "While the nuts are roasting, prepare a small pot for the eggs with enough water to cover the eggs then let boil. Once the water has boiled, add the eggs and let boil for 12 mins."
- "Prepare the cucumber by slicing them into quarters and thinly slice the nectarines. I have also added sliced tomatoes before and they pair well in this salad. Any summer veggies will do. It&#39;s also important to wash the lettuce thoroughly and to rip them into bite-sized pieces to place into a large bowl."
- "Once the eggs have boiled and cooked, slice them vertically and add to the salad along with the nuts, cucumber, nectarines, and honey."
- "Add a dressing of your choice, and a sandwich to complete your meal. I paired my salad with tuna on Newfoundland bread."
- "Enjoy!"
