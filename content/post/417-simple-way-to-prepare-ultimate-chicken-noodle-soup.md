- "Pour reserved broth into pot with vegetables and add water until it reaches about 9 quarts. Add remaining seasonings and bring to rolling boil, lower heat to medium and cook for 30 minutes (or until vegetables are tender) with lid on your pot."
- "Shred and add reserved chicken breast along with egg noodles to pot and cook for 8 minutes or until noodles are cooked through."
- "I serve mine with freshly baked olive oil bread."
