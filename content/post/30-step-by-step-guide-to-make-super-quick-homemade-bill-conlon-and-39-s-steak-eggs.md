recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the leftover steak into bite-sized pieces. The photos give you an idea of approximately how much steak you need when using 6 eggs. The small cup above the cutting board is the leftover pan drippings saved from cooking the steak in a cast iron skillet....loads of flavor in those drippings!"

- "Over medium-high heat, add oil and butter to a large skillet. Pour in steak-eggs batter, the size of small pancakes so they&#39;re easier to flip. Sprinkle with seasonings. Cook until just set, about 2-3 minutes, then flip and cook about 1 minute longer."
- "Serve warm. If desired, top with sautéed mushrooms or mushroom gravy. I also like snacking on leftover steak-eggs cold right out of the fridge!"
