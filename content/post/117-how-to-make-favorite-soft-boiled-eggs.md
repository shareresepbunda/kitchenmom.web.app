recipeinstructions:
- "Lay the eggs carefully into a pot of boiling water. Make sure the water covers the eggs completely. Boil for 4 1/2 minutes for super runny yolks and barely set whites, or up to 6 minutes for jammy yolks and fully set whites. I usually go with 5 minutes."
- "Move the eggs to an ice bath, or a bowl under running cold water. Let them cool completely."
- "Tap the eggs lightly all over with the back of a spoon. Peel them, starting at the fat end, under running cold water. As you&#39;d expect, the less cooked the eggs the more delicate this process."
- "To make the sandwich in the picture, slather a slice of toasted sourdough with some chipotle mayo (mayo with a few dashes of chipotle powder and a pinch of salt), avocado slices, bacon, and a 5 minute egg."
