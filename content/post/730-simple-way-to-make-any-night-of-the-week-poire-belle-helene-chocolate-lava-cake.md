- "Using a small sharp knife to scrape out all the seeds carefully.  Place the pears immediately into the syrup or it will oxidize very quickly.  Fill the pot with more water, just enuff to submerge the pears and only if necessary.  Return the pot back onto the heat."
- "Cut out a round parchment paper to cover the pears and the syrup.  This will ensure even coloring of the pears.  Bring it up to a simmer and turn the heat down to low.  Cover and poach the pears for 20 to 30 mins.  Remove from heat and let chill in the fridge overnight, with the parchment paper still in tact."
- "Prepare the lava cakes.  Preheat oven to 230 degree celsius or 450 fahrenheit.  On a double boiler, add chocolate."

- "Add the chocolate batter into the ramekins.  *These lava cakes will not be able to unmold. If you would like to serve these on a serving plate, lightly grease a pastry ring with some butter and wrap the inner circumference with parchment paper. Place the pastry ring on the serving plate and pour the batter into the ring.*  Pour about 3/4 way full."
- "Wack into the oven and bake for 8 mins.  The edge should be hard while the middle is still soft and jiggly.  Drain pears from the syrup."
- "Place 1 pear into each ramekins or pastry rings.  It is okay if there&#39;re cracks. That is the beauty of this dish.  Wack back into the oven and bake for a further 5 mins."
- "Remove from oven.  Plating.  Garnish with some rose petals and mint on the sides  Sprinkle some gold dust over the top.  Serve immediately."
