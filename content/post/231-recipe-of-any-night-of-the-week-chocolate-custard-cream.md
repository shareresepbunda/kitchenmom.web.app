recipeinstructions:
- "Chop up the chocolate. I used a normal chocolate bar that you can buy anywhere. (It doesn&#39;t have to be baking chocolate. The ones you can buy at any supermarket are good enough.)"
- "Put the ★ ingredients in a small sauce pan and mix well before you heat. (If you want to have a smooth silky texture, strain the mixture through a sieve here.)"
- "Heat over low heat and keep stirring. Once it starts to thicken, it hardens quickly, so keep stirring!"

- "The chocolate blends in very quickly."
- "When you cool the custard cream, cover with cling film. Make sure it touches the surface of the custard cream as shown in the photo. This will prevent the surface from drying out."
- "If you chill the custard cream in the fridge, it will set firmly. Use it as a bread filling and so on. There are so many ways you can use it."
- "A small sauce pan and whisk are better when making this custard cream. (See the photo on the right.) A small whisk is very handy. I bought mine at a 100 yen shop."
- "Use 1 leveled tablespoon of cake flour and corn starch. Use 1 rounded tablespoon of granulated sugar."
- "FYI: We don&#39;t strain the mixture through a sieve in Step 2, but it&#39;s still delicious (It may have some tiny lumpy bits)."
