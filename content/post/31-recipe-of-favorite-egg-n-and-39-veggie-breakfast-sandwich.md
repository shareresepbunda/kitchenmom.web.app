recipeinstructions:
- "Toast the bread before you forget. Just get it done now. &#34;Eh, it might be cold later-&#34; yeah well that&#39;s what you get. Enjoy the crunchy mouthfeel at least. Crush the garlic while your at it so it has time to get like, super smelly."
- "Slice the avocado in half, and the side with no seedpit, take the knife and like.. gently slice it while it&#39;s still in the rind cup? Scoop the slices out with a spoon later. (Yeah, I&#39;m a hack. A life hack.)"
- "Cook the bacon and set it aside on a paper towel."
- "Cut up the mushrooms into thick slices, and put them into a pan with a little olive oil. That garlic from earlier? Put it into a garlic press and watch it playdo out the holes, shave off that mess with the spatula- right into the pan. Wait for &#39;shrooms to get dark and small. Remove and set aside. Clean pan with paper towel."
- "Butter the pan, crack that yummy egg into the pan all gentle like. If your stovetops a broken tilting piece of shit, hold the pan at an angle until the white sets on the bottom- that way it wont run all over the pan like a drunk friend. Take your spatula and flip him, like scooping a cat off your lap without waking it up."
- "Before removing egg- Take toast out, put on plate. Scoop those avocado slices (CALL BACK) onto the bottom layer. Put sauteed mushrooms on that. Then the bacon slices- break them to fit the bread in a sturdy way."
- "Place egg onto bacon- then sprinkle parmesan cheese on hot egg. Place second toast on top."
- "Bite into that sucker like you just hunted it. Feel the yolk goo over the bread onto your ravenous face. Yes. You&#39;ve won."
