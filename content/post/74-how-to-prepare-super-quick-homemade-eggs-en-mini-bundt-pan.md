recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-Heat enough oil to fry potatoes. Wash potato thoroughly. Dry and poke vigorously with fork. Wrap in plastic wrap and put in the microwave on the potato setting. Remove and allow to cool. Fry bacon and allowed to drain on wire rack. Cut potatoes and two home fries or french fry style. Add olive oil from can of mackerel into frying pan and sauté vegetables. Set aside."
- "Make a roux with the flour and butter and milk. When it is smooth, add and cheese and stir. Fold in mackerel and vegetables into the roux. Pour mixture into pans and top with an egg. Assemble a steamer and place the pans inside when water is boiling. While steaming, fry the potatoes."
- "Depending on how you like your eggs, that will determine the cooking time. You can open the lid periodically and tap the yolk of the egg with your finger to test for doneness. Top with fried potatoes, green onion, shredded cheddar and bacon. Most chances are you will have surplus potatoes and bacon. I personally do not see a problem with that, you should consider yourself lucky."
