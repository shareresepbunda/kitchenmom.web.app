Hey everyone, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, our family&#39;s homemade ramen. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Ramen is a Japanese soup, by way of Chinese noodles, that has become an American obsession.

Making ramen from scratch is pretty darn elaborate. For a weekend project, try our homemade shoyu ramen recipe that walks you through four important components: dashi and tare for the soup base. Kombu is a type of kelp that is ubiquitous in Japanese cooking.
