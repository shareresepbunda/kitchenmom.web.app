recipeingredient:
- "100 grams Cake flour"
- "20 grams Almond flour if you dont have any you can substitute cake flour The texture and taste will be different"
- "60 grams Butter room temperature"
- "40 grams Granulated sugar"
- "1 pinch Salt"
- "1 Egg yolk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cream the butter. Put in the salt, and add the sugar in 2 to 3 batches, mixing well between additions. When the mixture becomes light and pale it&#39;s good."
- "Add the egg yolk to the butter mixture, and mix in well."
- "Sift the almond flour and cake flour in, and mix with a spatula. When the dough is no longer floury, bring together with your hands."
- "Wrap with plastic film, and leave to rest in the refrigerator for at least an hour in the refrigerator. (I always make double the amount, and freeze half.)"
- "Butter a tart mold lightly and dust with bread flour (or if you don&#39;t have any, use cake flour instead). Shake out any excess flour."
- "Sandwich the rested dough between 2 sheets of plastic film and roll out 3 mm thick. Line the tart mold with the dough, and cut off any excess dough by rolling a rolling pin over the mold or with a palette knife."
- "Pierce the bottom with a fork. (If you have some time, cover with plastic wrap and rest for more than an hour in the refrigerator. This prevents the crust from shrinking while baking.)"
- "Line the crust with a piece of foil or kitchen parchment paper and put in some pie weights. (You can use adzuki beans or raw rice instead)."
- "Bake in a pre-heated 170°C oven for 15 minutes. Take the weights out paper and all, and bake for another 15 to 18 minutes until golden brown."
- "Take the crust out of the oven and leave to cool completely. Remove from the mold."
- "You can also bake the crust without weights, but the shape will crumble a little bit. After Step 7 above, bake in a preheated 170°C oven for 20 to 30 minutes. When it is a nice golden brown it&#39;s done."
- "Point 1: In Step 9, if you cover the edges of the crust with foil too, you can prevent them from getting burned."
- "Point 2: Be sure to mix the floury ingredients in well. If you don&#39;t mix them in well the crust may break apart easily. If you loosen up the dough before rolling it out, it will become firmer and stronger."
- "If you are using the crust for a cheese tart or any filling that requires a partially baked crust, the baking time will vary depending on the recipe."
- "If you will be filling the crust with custard or similar, take the crust out of the oven 5 minutes before it&#39;s done, and brush the bottom thinly with beaten egg (or beaten egg white), and return to the oven."
- "Use the tart crust for fresh fruit tarts, chocolate tarts, no-bake cheese tarts and more."
- "I made cookies with leftover dough. Crispy and delicious!"
- "I tried baking a not-so-sweet sweet potato filling in this crust.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/169507-sweet-potato-tarts"
- "you can even bake a Rilakkuma by adapting this crust."
