How to poach eggs: Gently boil water in a large pot. If you&#39;re thinking, &#34;What the heck is a gentle boil?&#34; just bring the water to a boil and then lower the heat, so the water is just bubbling but not boiling like crazy.

Barely Simmering Water Makes the Best Poached Eggs The main trick I use when I make poached eggs is to use water that is barely simmering. Fewer bubbles means less agitation of the water that can break up and disperse the egg whites.
