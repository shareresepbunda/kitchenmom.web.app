recipeinstructions:

Add lemon rind and beat until smooth. Set aside. Whisk the egg whites and add the cream of tartar, beating to soft peaks. Add the sugar gradually and continue beating until stiff. Fold a third of the meringue into the cake mixture to loosen it. Gently fold in the remaining egg white mixture."
- "Pour gently the mixture into the prepared custard pan. Do not beat/stir. Place the cake pan in a bain-marie (bagno maria). Bake in the oven for an (1) hour or until the mixture is firm."
- "Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool until room temperature. Remove from water to cool completely."
- "To serve, run a spatula or knife along the edge of the mold/pan to loosen the caramel. Transfer into a serving round dish and chill before serving."
