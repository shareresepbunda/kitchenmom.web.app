recipeingredient:
- "100 ml Heavy cream with high fat content"
- "100 ml Milk"
- "25 grams Fine granulated sugar"
- "1/4  Vanilla bean or vanilla bean paste"
- "2 Egg yolks medium"
- "1/2 tsp Rum white rum"
- "1 Caramel sauce see"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make a caramel sauce, referring tofor Reddish-brown caramel sauce."
- "Put 3 teaspoons of caramel sauce in each container, and chill them in the refrigerator."
- "Put enough water in a deep pot to come 2/3rds of the way up the sides of the pudding containers, and bring it to a boil."
- "Put the ★ ingredients in a pan and heat until it feels a bit hot to the touch while mixing it to dissolve the sugar. Turn off the heat. The liquid should be about 50°C."
- "I used vanilla bean paste this time. If you&#39;re using a vanilla bean, cut it in half lengthwise, scrape out the seeds inside and add the pod and the seeds into the pan."
- "If you heat the liquid too much, the egg yolks may coagulate so be careful! Beat the yolks well in a bowl first, and add them little by little the the liquid."
- "Add the rum also and mix it in. Try not to introduce air bubbles as you mix."
- "Strain the liquid through a tea strainer. If you can strain it 3 times, even though it&#39;s a lot of work, it will be perfect! Do strain it at least once."
- "If there&#39;s a film on the surface, remove it quickly using a paper towel."
- "Pour the liquid into the chilled pudding containers. If any bubbles form on the surface, burst them by touching them quickly with the edge of a paper towel."
- "If you have some food grade disinfecting alcohol spray, you can quickly spray the puddings to get rid of any surface bubbles! The alcohol will evaporate while the puddings are steaming."
- "Turn the heat down really low under the pot full of boiling water. Cover the pudding containers and lower them into the water. If your pudding containers don&#39;t have lids, cover them tightly with aluminum foil or plastic wrap."
- "Cover the pot with a lid, and steam over very, very low heat for 7 minutes. Turn the heat off, and leave the pot with the lid still on for 10 minutes."
- "The puddings are set if they don&#39;t run when you tilt them, and the surface looks gelified. If they are still too liquid, turn the heat back on at a very low setting and steam the puddings a while longer."
- "The heat is very low, so that you should only see a few tiny bubbles in the bottom of the pot. If the water is bubbling too much, shift the lid a bit so that there&#39;s a gap."
- "When the puddings are cooked, take them out of the pot and let them cool down before refrigerating them. They are best eaten the following day, when they will have lost their eggy smell!"
- "Creamy, sublime custard pudding."
- "1 teaspoon of vanilla bean paste is the equivalent of 1 vanilla bean. Real vanilla bean paste is packed with flavor and really convenient to use!"
- "The steaming time differs depending on the pan you use. If the pan you are using doesn&#39;t retain heat well."
- "It may be better to steam the puddings 2 to 3 minutes longer."
- "Refer tofor the caramel sauce."
- "I&#39;d previously written here that vanilla essence was OK too, but a real vanilla bean or vanilla bean paste are so much better so I have edited the recipe to reflect that."
