recipeinstructions:

- "Mix the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Keep mixing until smooth. Should be a thick but still runny mixture."
- "Heat up a dry pan to a low/medium heat. NO oil / butter."
- "Test the heat by putting a small bit of mixture and flipping once bubbles appear. It should take about 1 minute on each side. This is your micro gastronomy test pancake."
- "Put a desert spoon of mixture into the pan for each pancake. I can fit two blobs in my drying pan at a time."
- "Flip when you see bubbles appear. This is typically after only a minute or two for me. Keep an eye on them so they don’t burn - do not hesitate to check!"
- "Cook for a minute on the other side. They will inflate like hovercrafts! Keep checking until you get the feel for how long they take to perfect."
- "Crucial step: keep on a warm plate in a warm (but not hot) oven. You don’t want to cook them any more. I don’t put tinfoil on top as the condensation underneath causes them to go soggy and then hard."
- "Serve with EVERYTHING."
