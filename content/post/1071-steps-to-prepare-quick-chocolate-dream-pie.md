recipeinstructions:
- "PREHEAT oven to 250째F. Separate the eggs. BEAT the egg whites and cream of tartar in a bowl on high speed until foamy. While still beating constantly, ADD the sugar, 2 Tbsp. at a time, beating after each addition until sugar is dissolved before adding the next. (Rub a bit of meringue between thumb and forefinger; it should feel completely smooth.) Continue beating until whites are glossy and stand in stiff peaks."
- "SPREAD the meringue into a 9-inch Pyrex pie plate. With the back of a spoon, build up the edge to form a rim. The finished result should be in the shape of a pie shell."
- "BAKE the shell in 250째F oven until firm and wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Turn off the oven. Let the shell dry in oven, with door closed, until it is cool and crisp, at least 1 hour."
- "Melt chocolate in a microwave safe dish"
- "In a bowl, beat the egg yolks, the sugar, salt and water."
- "Using a mixer, slowly stir some of the melted hot chocolate into the egg yolk mixture. Constant mixing is required so that the hot chocolate doesn&#39;t curdle the egg yolks. Keep adding the chocolate, stirring constantly, until all the chocolate has been added to the egg yolks and the mixture is smooth."
- "Transfer the mixture into a double boiler and heat on low until thick."
- "Remove from heat and put aside to cool. At least 2 hours or overnight."
- "Whip the cream until it forms soft peaks."
- "Fold the chocolate mixture into the whipped cream. Since the chocolate mixture is thick (very much like fudge) I find it easier to add the chocolate to the whipped cream by the spoonful and then folding it a little at a time. Once the all the chocolate has been folded into the whipped cream, it&#39;s ready to spoon it into the meringue shell."
- "Cover the pie with plastic wrap and chill for at least 4 hours."
- "Before Serving, make the whipped cream topping. To do this, put the heavy cream, vanilla and sugar in a bowl and beat until the cream is stiff. Spread the whipped cream on top of the pie and sprinkle the top with grated chocolate."
