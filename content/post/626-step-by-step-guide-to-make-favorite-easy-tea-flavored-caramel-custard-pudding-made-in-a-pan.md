- "Turn off the heat, return the pudding you took out to the pan, replace the lid and leave the pudding as is for 2 to 3 hours. (They&#39;ll become a bit firmer with the residual heat of the water.)"
- "Chill in the refrigerator and it&#39;s done. The caramel is still, so the pudding may be better the next day when the caramel has dissolved properly."

- "Punpuntan added  small amount of tea leaves as a variation. It should be even more fragrant and delicious."
