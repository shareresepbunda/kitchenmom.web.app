- "【For Caramel Sauce】 Put the granulated sugar and 2 Tbsp water in a small pot. Heat it on medium heat. When the edge becomes yellow, move the pot sometimes to make it evenly golden."
- "When it turns golden brown and steam rises strongly, turn off the heat. Add 1.5 Tbsp water. Please be careful as the hot caramel splash. Stir it to smooth. If it becomes uneven, heat on low heat to smooth. Pour the caramel into cups. Set aside."
- "【For Chocolate Pudding】 Preheat an oven to 170℃ / 338F. Put chocolate into a bowl. If chocolate is a large block, cut it into small pieces. Pour the milk into another bowl. Add 1 tsp granulated sugar to the milk and stir. Microwave the milk at 500 W for 2 mins or until steam rises. (The granulated sugar prevents scum from forming on the milk.)"
- "Pour the hot milk over the chocolate until the chocolate is soaked. Microwave it at 500 W for 1.5 mins. Melt it until smooth while stirring slowly."
- "Sift cocoa powder over the chocolate milk, and mix. Use a whisk to stir until smooth and cocoa lumps disappear. Add the remaining slightly warm milk in 2 parts, and stir well each time. Set aside. Set aside."
- "Put eggs in a large bowl. Mix gently so as not to foam until it gets watery. Crush the yolks and scoop egg liquid up and let it slip through your whisk. Repeat until smooth. Add granulated sugar, and stir well for 1.5 mins."
- "Pour half of the chocolate milk into the egg while straining, stir well for 1.5 mins until smooth. Pour the remaining chocolate milk while straining, stir well for 1.5 mins until smooth. Strain the mixture again."
- "Pour the mixture into each cup. Put a deep-sided container (heat‐resistance) on a baking tray, and line the deep-sided container with a cloth. Pour plenty of 50℃ / 122 F hot water into the container. If you mix water and boiling water in the same ratio, it reaches about 50℃ / 122 F."
- "Place the cups in hot water and cover each cup with aluminum foil. Bake it at 150℃ / 302 F for 35-40 mins. Bake them until the center shakes a little."
- "After baking, leave it in the oven for 5 mins with the door closed. Use the residual heat to cook to the center. 5 mins later, take it out, and quickly cool down with ice water. Let them cool in a fridge overnight."
- "Put the bottom of the cup in hot water for 5 mins to loosen the caramel. Use a wet spoon to push the edge. At first, push it lightly and make one turn, then make several turns while pushing deeper gradually. Continue to push until caramel will exude."
- "Place a plate on the top, and turn upside down and shake strongly. After the pudding falls on the plate, remove the cup."
- "Serve it with whipped cream and a cherry, drip some rum on. It&#39;s smooth and creamy chocolate pudding!"
