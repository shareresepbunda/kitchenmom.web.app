Ianya ala ala Scramble Eggs tapi versi Melayu di mana adanya cili bawang belacan dsb. Saya alah dengan belacan jadi kebanyakan resepi saya tidak menggunakan belacan. Kalau anda boleh makan belacan, rasanya pasti lagi sedap kerana adanya perisa udang geragau dalam belacan. Hmmm semuanya gara gara Sambal Tumis Telur ini menyebabkan saya makan banyak malam ni, nasi lemak lagi.
