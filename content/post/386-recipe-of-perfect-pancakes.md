recipeinstructions:
- "Mix flour, baking powder, salt, sugar in a big bowl. Make a well in the middle and pour the milk, egg and melted butter, mix until fairly combined. Try not to overmix your batter. Don&#39;t worry about small lumps, they&#39;ll disappear once you cook your pancakes."
- "Heat a lightly oiled flat pan over medium heat. I use a ladle to portion and pour my pancakes. Fry until you have bubbles that are fixed on the top. Flip the pancake and cook for slightly less time than the first side. I find it better to add things like chocolate chips by throwing them into the pancake while they&#39;re cooking, but you can add them to the batter if you&#39;re more comfortable."
- "Stack the pancakes as they are done. Cover with your choice of toppings; butter, jam, maple syrup, honey, cut fruit, chocolate syrup"
