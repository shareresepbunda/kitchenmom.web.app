- "1 dash Salt and pepper"
- "1 dash Margarine"

recipeinstructions:
- "Make 2 cm-deep cuts on all sides of the sliced bread. Butter 4 muffin cups, and press each slice of bread into a cup, folding them so that they are flower shaped."
- "Line each bread cup with a half slice of bacon first. Cut the cheese slices into half, and place in the cups so that it crosses over the bacon."
- "Top with the eggs. If you use very small-size chicken eggs, the white will run out, so break the eggs on a plate first and add to the cups little by little. If you are using quail eggs, you can just break them in."
- "Season with salt and pepper, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes in a 160°C oven. Please check on how the eggs are cooking. Cook for a short time only if using quail eggs!"
- "Optionally add some ketchup and mayonnaise mixed together in equal amounts. If you eat this while breaking up the yolk, it&#39;s sooo good!"
- "You can also bake the bread cups without the eggs, and fill with potato salad. Fill the cups with potato salad using a piping bag, then garnish with cheese and bacon."
