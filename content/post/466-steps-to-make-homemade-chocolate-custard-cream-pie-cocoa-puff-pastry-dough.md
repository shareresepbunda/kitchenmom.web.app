- "【For Cocoa Puff Pastry】 Mix cocoa and powdered sugar while crushing lumps. Put bread flour, cake flour, and salt in a bowl. (70g bread flour and 70g cake flour can be replaced with 140g all-purpose flour.) Add the cocoa sugar mixture to the flour, stir well, set aside."
- "Dice unsalted butter into about 5mm (0.2-inch). You should prepare well-chilled butter. Put diced butter into a large bowl. Add the flour mixture to the diced butter."
- "Toss to coat the cubed butter with flour. Crush and rub the cubes while mixing. Use a scraper in the second half to mix while cutting to prevent the butter from melting by the heat from your fingers. Mix it until the color becomes about evenly."
- "Pour half of the water over like drawing circles, mix roughly. You should prepare well-chilled water. Pour the remaining water, and mix roughly."
- "Put onto plastic wrap. Press lightly to a single mass. Flatten it and shape it square, wrap it with plastic wrap. It has some unevenness at this stage. Let it sit in a fridge for 3 hours (If possible, overnight)."
- "【For Chocolate Custard Cream】 Break the chocolate into small pieces and add 3Tbsp milk to it. Microwave it at 500W for 1 min, and mix well to melt the chocolate. Sift cocoa powder with a tea strainer over the chocolate milk. Stir it until smooth. Set aside."
- "Put egg yolks and sugar in a bowl, mix with a whisk for 1.5 mins until heavy and whitish."
- "Sift cake flour over the egg mixture, and mix lightly until combined. Add vanilla oil, stir well. Add the milk in 4 parts. Stir well each time."
- "Microwave it at 500W for 1 min and mix it well. Repeat that 4 times until heavy and creamy. Please mix well each time. It should get heavy and creamy at the 4th time."
- "Strain the chocolate milk over the custard, and stir well. Microwave it at 500W for 30 sec and mix it well. Repeat that twice."
- "Put the hot chocolate custard in a flat container, cover it with plastic wrap, and put ice packs or ice on to cool down quickly. After cooling down, let it sit in a fridge."
- "【Fold the puff pastry dough.】 Take the dough out of the fridge. If your dough is hard, please leave it for about 10 mins at room temperature to soften a little. Flour your work surface, dough, and rolling pin. Roll out into a long rectangle of 5-7mm (0.2-0.3&#39;&#39;) thick, while coating it lightly with bread flour. Fold the top third of the pastry down, then the bottom third up."
- "Rotate the dough 90 degrees. Roll out and tri-fold it again. Wrap it with plastic wrap and chill it for 30 mins. (If the dough becomes soft on the way, please cool it once.)"
- "Repeat this whole process two more times (roll, tri-fold, 90℃ rotate, roll, tri-fold, chill). The dough will get smooth gradually."
- "【For Assembling】 Divide the dough into 6 parts. Roll each into 12 cm / 4.7&#39;&#39; square (3mm / 0.1&#39;&#39; thick) while coating it lightly with flour. Let it sit in a freezer for 20 mins. Preheat an oven to 220℃ / 428F."
- "Cut 6 sheets into a square 10cm x 10cm (3.9&#39;&#39; x 3.9&#34;). Fold it in half so the bottom point meets the top point. Make two incisions in it, 1cm in from the outside, in a diamond shape, but make sure they do not meet at the top."
- "Open the pastry, brush lightly the inside of incisions with water. Fold the left diamond to the right and the right diamond to the left to make a smaller diamond in the center and two points coming out of either side."
- "Prick holes in the bottom(center diamond) with a fork. Bake it at 200℃ / 392 F for 18 mins, 160℃ / 320 F for 5 mins. After baking, press each bottom lightly. Let it cool on a rack."
- "Take the chocolate custard out of the fridge. Mix lightly until smooth, and put into each pie. Sprinkle a pinch of cocoa over each cream. It&#39;s all done!!"
- "I made stick pies with the remaining puff pastry, bake 200℃ / 392 F for 15 mins, and dip them into the remaining chocolate cream. It&#39;s delicious too!"
