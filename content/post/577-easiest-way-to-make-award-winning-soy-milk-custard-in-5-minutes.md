recipeingredient:
- " Banana If you want to make it a rich yellow egglike color try using 50 g boiled kabocha squash instead of the banana"
- " Soy milk"
- " Raw cane sugar or beet sugar"
- " Cake flour or cornstarch"
- " Vanilla oil"
- " Cream cheese if desired Can be omitted with no problem for those who dont use dairy products"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mash the banana in a large bowl.  This time we&#39;re making banana custard, but you can omit the banana if you&#39;re making another kind of dessert."
- "Add in the cream cheese here, if using. Soften either at room temperature or for 30 seconds in the microwave first, and mix it in well."
- "Stir in the raw cane sugar, cake flour and vanilla oil, in that order."
- "Add the soy milk and continue mixing. (It&#39;s alright if there are a few lumps at this stage.)"
- "Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 2 minutes, until the edges are bubbling lightly.Take it out of the microwave and beat it well with a whisk."
- "Put it back in the microwave and heat for 1 minute. When the edges start bubbling again, take it out and mix well."
- "If it&#39;s not thick enough, put it back in the microwave and repeat the process of heating and mixing, for 30 seconds at a time. The photo shows a good thickness for things like cream-filled buns."
- "It&#39;s done when it reaches the thickness you desire. Spread it out in a shallow container, cover with plastic wrap and chill it in the fridge. You can also just cover the bowl as-is with plastic wrap."
- "To make on the stovetop: Steps 1-4 are the same. Then, transfer the mixture from the bowl to a pot and cook it over low heat, stirring continuously. When it&#39;s thickened to your liking, it&#39;s done!"
- "This is what it looks like made with kabocha squash instead of banana. It looks and tastes like it&#39;s made with egg Macrobiotic recipes often use kabocha squash instead of eggs."
- "&#34;Caramel Banana Trifle&#34; made with custard, sliced bananas, whipped cream, nuts and topped with caramel sauce."
- "If you have custard left over, make custard toast. Just spread lots of custard on top of bread and toast it. It tastes just like cream-filled buns."
