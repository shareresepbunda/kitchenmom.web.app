It&#39;s served with a poached egg on top so that each person can mix in the creamy yolk as they enjoy the meal. The recipe calls for you to add peas to brighten the dish. The acidity helps prevent the egg from &#34;feathering&#34; (which is when the egg whites splay out and don&#39;t stay wrapped around the yolk). Carefully place one of the poached eggs in the dish with the flour and turn over to coat the egg evenly. Move the floured egg to the dish with the beaten egg and turn to coat.
