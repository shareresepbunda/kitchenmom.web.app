Schools &amp; malls are closed and most people have to work from home for the next three weeks. I added soba noodles, mushrooms and Chinese spinach to go with the shrimp wontons, making this a healthy one-dish meal. In place of yuzu juice (hard to find), I used lemon juice. The book features traditional classics like shrimp wontonâ€¦and also modern takes on Asian food: Korean Grilled Steak Tacos with Kimchee Slaw: I used. Carefully add the shrimp to the wok and stir fry until the shrimp is pink.
