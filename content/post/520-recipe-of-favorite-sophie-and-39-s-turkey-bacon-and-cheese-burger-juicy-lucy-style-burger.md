recipeingredient:
- "500 grams lean Turkey mince"
- "1/2 cup breadcrumbs"
- "1/2 cup milk"
- "1 egg"
- "1 salt and pepper to season or add some chili if you like"
- "1 you can substitute 1 tablespoon of milk for 1 tablespoon of BBQ sauce this will caramelise it slightly but I like that"
- "4 bacon medallions"
- "40 grams Grated cheese I like cheddar but Monterey Jack or mozzarella would also work well"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 170°&#39;"
- "Mix milk and breadcrumbs together and leave for 5 minutes."
- "Gently mix in all of the rest of the ingredients, except the cheese and the bacon."
- "Shape your mix into 8 burgers."
- "Place your cheese in the middle of 4 of your burgers, approx 10g on each. Top with your bacon (it&#39;s best to use raw bacon add it&#39;s easier to shape the final burger. This is why I use medallions as there will be no fat on it that would need pre cooking)."
- "Put one of the empty burgers on top of one with topping, and seal the edges together, sealing the bacon and cheese inside."
- "You will find that one side is flat and the other well have a bump - I gently throw my burgers between my hands to make it an even shape, but you can leave it if you like. Check there are no cracks to the inside - you don&#39;t want your cheese leaking out!"
- "Bake in the oven for approx 30 mins - alternatively try it on the BBQ!"
- "Enjoy!"
