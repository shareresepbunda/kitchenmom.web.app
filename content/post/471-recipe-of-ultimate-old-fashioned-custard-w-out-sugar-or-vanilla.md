recipeingredient:
- " eggs"
- " half and half"
- " salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix ingredients with a fork or whip. Some say to filter the egg mixture, but I let the egg solids fall off the fork/whip away from my mixture."
- "Pour into 4 custard cups on a pan deep enough to hold water up to at least ¼ height of the cup."
- "Heat water and pour -- hot, not boiling water -- on pan around cups. I prefer a big oven for custard so I don&#39;t make a mistake with the hot -- not boiling -- water. But I&#39;ve made it many times in a toaster oven."
- "Cook at 350 degrees for 20-30 minutes, (maybe 400 in a toaster oven) until a knife inserted into custard comes out clean. They&#39;ll brown on top."
- "When you remove from oven, put ice cubes into water to cool it. Wait a bit before touching and a little more before trying them. They go down easy, but I take it easy because they&#39;re eggs and cream, don&#39;t you know?"
