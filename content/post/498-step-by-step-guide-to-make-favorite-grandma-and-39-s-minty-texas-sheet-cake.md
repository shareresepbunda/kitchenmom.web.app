recipeingredient:
- " Sheet Cake"
- "1 cup butter no substitutions butter only please"
- "1 cup water"
- "4 tbsp cocoa"
- "2 cup granulated sugar"
- "2 cup allpurpose flour"
- "1/2 cup sour cream or buttermilk"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "1 tsp baking soda"
- "2 eggs beaten"
- " Icing"
- "1 stick butter"
- "4 tbsp cocoa"
- "6 tbsp milk I used 2"
- "2 3/4 cup confectioners sugar powdered sugar"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1/2 cup chopped Andes creme de menthe baking chips or your favorite nuts"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350°F. Melt butter in saucepan.  Add water &amp; cocoa.  Bring to a boil."
- "Remove pot from heat, set aside. Add sugar, flour, salt, baking soda, beaten eggs, sour cream, and vanilla to your stand mixer bowl. Mix for 30 seconds on low speed, until incorporated. (This step can be done by hand in a bowl with a wisk or spoon too. Don&#39;t make it complicated. Do what&#39;s convenient for you, the result will still be amazing! )"
- "Carefully pour butter, H2O (aka water), cocoa mixture over flour mixture. Mix for about a minute on low speed."
- "Stop mixer and scrape down sides with a spoon or spatula to ensure all the goodness is incorporated. Continue mixing another 30 seconds."
- "Pour batter into greased (I used coconut oil spray) jelly roll pan or baking sheet with a depth of about 3/4&#34;. DO NOT overfill your pan, the cake will rise. 50% full should allow you to pour the icing over the cake without difficulty in our later step.  2/3 full will give you a taller cake in the center which the icing will pour off some towards the edges (this is totally okay as the icing sets pretty quick) definitely don&#39;t pour more than 2/3 full though. You will find your sweet spot after making this cake a few times."
- "Place pan gently in the oven for 20 minutes on the center rack."
- "After the cake has baked for 10 minutes gather your icing ingredients.  In a saucepan place butter, cocoa and milk. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat. Add confectioners sugar &amp; vanilla. Combine with a wisk until sugar is well incorporated and free of lumps (don&#39;t stress about this, a few lumps never killed anyone.  By now your whole house smells like beautiful chocolatiness anyways and your almost done! Yay you.) (At this point you could add your favorite chopped nuts, my kiddos prefer sans nuts though.)"
- "Pour icing directly on cake as soon as it comes out of the oven. You may need to corale the icing with a spatula to keep it from running off the cake if your cake is too tall. Don&#39;t stress, you are about to enjoy some nummy Texas Sheet cake! Icing will form a crust on top and begin to set up in a few minutes. Sprinkle with chopped Andes mints (our grocer sells them already chopped by the chocolate chips) or nuts before icing sets."
- "Allowing the cake to cool will make it easier to cut and serve. But lets face it. You worked hard, and you want to eat it right now, I know you do.  ENJOY cooking this yummy Texas Sheet Cake with your Clann!"
