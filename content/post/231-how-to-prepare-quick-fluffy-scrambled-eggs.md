recipeinstructions:
- "Over medium high heat, melt 1/2 tablespoon butter in a 6&#34; non-stick skillet. Begin toasting 2 slices of bread."
- "Crack 2 eggs into a small bowl and add 1 teaspoon 2% milk or coffee cream. Lightly beat until the yolks and whites are broken up and the eggs start to become a consistent color. Do not whip, we&#39;re not making an omelette."
- "When the butter melts and is bubbling, pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Season with 1 dash of salt. As the edges of the mixture begin to cook, with a plastic utensil (fork or spatula), pull the edges toward the middle. The uncooked mixture will run out to replace it and it will cook. Continue until you have a loosely cooked mixture in the center of your skillet."
- "When the bread is toasted, stop whatever you&#39;re doing &amp; immediately spread with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, cut in half and plate."
- "Flip the eggs, wait a few seconds and flip &#39;em back. If you want to add cheese, do it now. To melt the cheese, steam with 1 tsp water &amp; a lid. The eggs will continue to cook as long as they&#39;re hot, so as the eggs are approaching desired consistency, plate &#39;em."
