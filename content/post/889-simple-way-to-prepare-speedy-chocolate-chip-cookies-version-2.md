Add Chocolate Chips and mix until dispersed evenly. Dough will be a bit dry and harder to work, but that&#39;s how it should be. This ensures the correct texture of this cookie.

- "For Soft Cookies, cook 10 Minutes. Let Cool for 2 Minutes, before transferring to a Cooling Rack. Let Cool for 30 Minutes before serving. Cookies will look pale, but they will be cooked."
- "For Regular Cookies, cook 12-16 Minutes. Let Cool for 2 Minutes, before transferring to a Cooling Rack. Let Cool another 5 - 10 Minutes, before serving."
- "Enjoy!"
