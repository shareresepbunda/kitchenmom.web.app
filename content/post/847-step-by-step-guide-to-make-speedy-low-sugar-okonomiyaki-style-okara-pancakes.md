- "180 grams 1825 grams sugar  99 calories Fresh okara"
- "2 Egg"
- "2 grams Powdered kanten"
- "1 package 3 grams 0 grams sugar  11 calories Bonito flakes"
- "2 grams Salt"
- "1 Your favorite ingredients"
- "200 grams Bean sprouts"
- "150 grams Pork shoulder roast chunks"
recipeinstructions:
- "Use the fresh okara as-is. Rehydrate as per the instructions if using a dried kind. I used a type that&#39;s rehydrated in 5 parts water. I added 30 g to 150 g water."
- "Combine the ☆ ingredients with Step 1 as they are listed in the ingredients list, and level it all out with a spatula.  Fresh okara will have a higher water content, so adjust the amount of water to the point where it feels a little lacking in moisture."
- "Add your preferred ingredients, and mix by hand. This time I used bean sprouts washed and broken up by massaging the bag, and pork bits with the fat cut off."
- "Press down and remove the air and form a patty so that it becomes 1/4 in size. Coat a heated frying pan with oil, and place the patty into the pan. Make another patty in the same manner and put it into the frying pan as well."
- "Cover with a lid, cook one side on medium for 4 minutes, flip over, and cook the other side for an additional 4 minutes. Shape 2 more patties, and cook them."
- "(These are small enough to pick up with a spatula and shouldn&#39;t fall apart easily, but might a little when flipping...)"
- "Serve onto plates, cover with okonomiyaki sauce and mayonnaise, top with dried bonito flakes or aonori seaweed, and enjoy (with plenty of water)."
- "Store leftovers in the fridge or freezer. They can be microwaved and served again. They will have a milder taste the next day than when they are freshly made."
