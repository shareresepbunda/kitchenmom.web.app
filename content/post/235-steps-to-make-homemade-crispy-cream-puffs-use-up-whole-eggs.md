recipeinstructions:

- "Cut open the vanilla pod and scrape the beans out. Add to the milk in a heatproof dish."
- "Microwave the milk without letting it boil and pour it through a sieve into Step 2. Heat over low until thickened without burning it."
- "After the mixture thickens, let cool. At Step 4, the mixture looks runny, but after it cools, it should look like this."
- "Make the choux batter. Preheat the oven to 190°C. Put the water and butter in a small sauce pan and bring to a boil."
- "After bringing to the boil, reduce the heat to low and add the flour in one go. Beat vigorously with a wooden spatula. When the paste doesn&#39;t stick to the side of the pan, remove from the heat."

- "It&#39;s done once the batter clings to the hand mixer like this."

- "Moisten your hands and shape each portion. They don&#39;t have to be neat! Touch and flatten any peaks."
- "Moisten your hand with water and sprinkle water on the parchment paper with your hands. You can spray it, if you like."
- "Bake at 190°C for 15 minutes and after the portioned batter has risen, reduce the temperature to 180°C  for a further 15 minutes until nicely browned."
- "-Important- After baking, turn the heat off and leave the choux in the oven for 15 minutes. Do not open the oven door."
- "After they cool down completely, make slits with a knife and discard the insides to make the pastries lighter."
- "Add sugar to the cream and whip with a hand mixer until stiff. Mix the cream and custard roughly, leaving a marble pattern."
- "Fill the cream in each choux pastry with a spoon."
- "It&#39;s done! Fill with fruits if you like. They&#39;re crispy when freshly made and moist after some time. I like it either way."
