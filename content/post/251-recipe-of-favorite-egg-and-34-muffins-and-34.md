Amazing flavors, like Cake Batter, Chocolate, Pumpkin Spice, Peach Cobbler, Mocha, and more! Also available as powder egg whites too! While you can often sub eggs in a savory recipe with another protein (like adding eggs to a curry or pilaf), this list is aimed at recipes that need their eggs for lift (think fluffy meringue, souffl√©, or waffles), binding (think burgers or patties), or moisture (muffins or loaf cakes). And there&#39;s always crossover (e.g. pancakes, which need to stick together and rise). A breakfast burrito on a plate with glass ramekins of salsa and sour cream.
