recipeingredient:
- "4 large Egg yolk"
- "5 large Egg whites"
- "100 grams Cake flour"
- "80 grams Granulated sugar"
- "45 ml Milk water"
- "40 ml Vegetable oil"
- "2 tbsp Instant coffee"
- "2 tsp Hot water"
- "1 tsp Coffee liqueur or hot water as substitute"
recipeinstructions:
- "Coffee liquid: Mix the ● ingredients and once dissolved, transfer the liquid into a bowl and set aside. Sift the cake flour. Preheat the oven to 170℃."
- "Separate the eggs into yolks and whites. Beat the egg whites while gradually adding in half of the sugar, and once formed into a firm meringue, chill in the fridge."
- "Add the rest of the sugar into the bowl containing the egg yolks, and whisk until white and thick. Add milk and vegetable oil."
- "Sift the flour you sifted in step 1 again into the bowl with the yolks, and mix well so that there are no lumps."
- "Fold in 1/3 of the meringue from step 2 to the yolk-flour mixture from step 4. Add another 1/3 of the meringue and mix together."
- "Transfer the batter to the bowl that held the meringue, and mix the batter using a cut-and-fold motion, to leave as much of the air in the meringue as possible."
- "Put 2 ladles full of the batter from step 6 to the bowl with the coffee liquid from step 1, and mix lightly."
- "Pour in the mixture from step 7 into the batter from step 6, and mix as if scooping up the batter from the bottom while spinning the bowl, about 3 times."
- "Pour the batter into the chiffon cake mold. While holding the middle of the mold, gently tap the mold against the kitchen counter twice to remove any large air bubbles."
- "Set the baking time for 30 minutes. First, bake for about 20 minutes at 170℃. Make 4 to 5 cuts in the surface with a serrated bread knife."
- "Reduce the temperature to 160℃ and bake for 10 minutes (or you can just keep baking at 170℃). If a skewer inserted into the cake comes out clean, it&#39;s done."
- "Remove the cake from the oven and invert it on top of a mug or cup, and wait until it is cooled fully. If you try to take it out of the mold while it&#39;s still hot, it will fall apart."
- "When the cake has cooled down, cut around it with a cake knife to separate it from the mold. Separate the cake from the center part with a bamboo skewer."
- "Invert onto a plate to unmold, and it&#39;s done."
- "It&#39;ll look like this when cut."
