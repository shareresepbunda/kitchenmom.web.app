- "1 large egg"
- "1 tbsp hummus"
- "1 tsp dijon mustard"
- "1/8 tsp cayenne or chili powder"
- "1 tbsp onion finely minced"
- "1 leaf coarsely chopped lettuce"
- "1 bunch green salad OR 1 pc toasted rice bread  tortilla"
- "1/4 tsp olive oil optional"
- "1 tbsp shredded mozarella cheese optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "On a small pot, fill with water about 5-6 cups (just enough to cover egg). Bring water to boil. Place egg on a spoon or laddle to submerge it at the boiling pot of water and turn down heat to medium. Let egg boil for 8 mins. Turn off heat, and let the egg rest on pot for at least a minute."
- "While the egg is boiling, toast your rice bread or rice tortilla, OR alternatively prepare your vegetables for salad."
- "While the egg is resting on pot, chop half of a small onion then place them on a small bowl. On the same bowl add hummus, dijon mustard, cayenne / chili powder, and olive oil (optional). Set it aside for a bit."
- "Fish out the egg from pot using laddle or spoon. Cool it through running water until bare hands can handle it. You don&#39;t want it too cold -- we want its heat to melt mozarella a bit for later."
- "De-shell the egg (careful it might still be hot) and place it on the same bowl of the premade mixture. Coarsely mash it, add shredded mozarella, then add 1 leaf chopped lettuce. Mix them well."
- "Serve the egg salad mix as toasted bread toppings, or as salad dressing. Enjoy!"
