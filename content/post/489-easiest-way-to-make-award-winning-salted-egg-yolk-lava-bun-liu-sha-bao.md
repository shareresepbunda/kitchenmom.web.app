- "Make filling: Steam the egg yolks for 10 minutes, then mash them into fine crumbs. In a medium bowl, beat the butter until softened. Add the yolks and the remaining ingredients. Mix until smooth. Cover and refrigerate to firm for about 45 minutes."
- "Divide the filling into 14 equal portions (about 13g each). Roll each into a smooth round ball. Keep them in the fridge until needed."
- "Make dough: Combine warm water (about 110°F/43°C) and 4 grams of sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over. Let sit for 5-10 minutes until it gets foamy and activated."
- "In a large bowl, whisk the flour, salt, and 8 grams of sugar until combined. Make a well in the center. Pour in the yeast mixture and oil, then mix until the dough comes together."
- "Transfer onto a work surface. Knead the dough until it becomes elastic and smooth for up to 20 minutes."
- "Divide the dough into 14 equal portions (about 33g each). Roughly shape each dough into a ball. Cover and rest them for 15 minutes to relax the gluten."
- "Take 1 dough. Roll out the edges keeping the center thicker. Place a portion of the chilled filling onto the center and wrap it. Tightly pinch the seam to prevent any leakage."
- "Round it into a ball and place onto a piece of parchment paper. Set aside with a cover. Repeat with the rest."
- "Let them sit and ferment for 45 – 60 minutes or until the size is 50% larger."
- "Steam the bun over medium-low heat (or medium heat depending on your type of steamer) for 6-8 minutes. I suggest doing a test with 1 bun to determine the right timing because the filling will explode when overcooked. Also, wrap the steamer lid with a cloth to prevent water droplets on the buns while steaming."
- "Wait 10 minutes after the heat is off before opening the lid. This will prevent the buns from collapsing. Serve warm to get that tasty molten filling."
