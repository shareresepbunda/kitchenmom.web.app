recipeingredient:
- "15 grams Pure cocoa powder"
- "60 ml Milk or sweetened soy milk"
- "4 Egg large size"
- "50 grams Caster sugar for the egg yolks"
- "40 grams Caster sugar for the egg whites"
- "45 grams Vegetable oil"
- "70 grams Cake flour"
- "150 ml Heavy cream can be substituted with whipping or lowfat cream"
- "15 grams Caster sugar"
- "50 grams Chocolate bar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Lightly coat the surface of the baking tray with oil and line with parchment paper.  Microwave the milk, add the pure cocoa powder and dissolve well."
- "Separate the egg whites and yolks, and place them in different bowls.  Pre-heat the oven to 170°C."
- "Add the sugar to the egg yolks and with an electric mixer beat until the mixture becomes pale yellow.  Add the mixed milk and cocoa powder into the bowl and mix on low speed.  Add the vegetable oil and whip some more."
- "Sift flour into the bowl from Step 3, and combine until evenly mixed with the electric mixer on low speed or by using a whisk."
- "While beating the egg whites, add sugar in several batches, and whip into a stiff peak meringue. Tilt the bowl occasionally to check the stiffness. The meringue should not drop even if you turn the bowl upside down. When the meringue gets to this stage, change the electric mixer to low speed and whip for another 3 - 4 minutes to make a smooth meringue."
- "The meringue is ready if the meringue does not drop when you turn the bowl upside down and if any markings made with the electric mixer remains without disappearing. The tip of the meringue peaks will droop (like it&#39;s taking a bow) but it should be stiff enough to stand on it&#39;s own.  If the meringue is too stiff, it might be difficult to incorporate the egg whites when you mix it into the batter later on."
- "Add about half of the meringue into the bowl from Step 3, and with a rubber spatula, mix by lifting from the bottom of the bowl and folding in. Mix well until all the ingredients are combined thoroughly."
- "Add the remaining meringue, folding carefully to maintain the airy texture. The batter should be thoroughly combined, fluffy and smooth."
- "Pour the batter into the baking tray. Gently shake the tray to even the surface. Tap the tray lightly a few times to eliminate any air bubbles. (Don&#39;t tap too much.)"
- "Bake for 15 - 20 minutes in the 170°C pre-heated oven. When it is done, take the tray out of the oven and drop the tray (with the cake still in it) from about 30 cm height to release the steam."
- "Place a sheet of parchment paper on the cooling rack. Flip the baked cake upside down onto the cooling rack. Peel off the parchment paper on the cake and lay the paper loosely on top.  Set aside to cool."
- "While the cake is cooling, make the chocolate cream. Finely chop the chocolate bar, microwave for about 1 minute and stir until completely melted.  In a bowl, add the sugar and heavy cream, and whip until soft peak stage.  Add the melted chocolate into the bowl, and whip until firm peak stage. The cream is ready."
- "After the cake has cooled, spread the cream. Spread the cream thicker on the near-side so it will be easier to roll up. Roll up the cake with the parchment paper, and be sure to roll tightly from the start."
- "※ Tightly roll up the cake working gently and slowly. If you rush this process the cake will break.  At the beginning, be sure to tuck the cake and cream in tightly.  Remove any excess cream."
- "Leave the parchment paper on, wrap it up with plastic wrap, adjust and fix the shape.  Chill in the fridge for at least an hour and it&#39;s done♫"
- "here will be plenty if you have 150 ml of cream. This amount is ideal for a cake baked in a 30 cm baking tray."
- "I also edited the amount of vegetable oil.  (actually I added too much by mistake)  You can add 45 g.  This addition might prevent the cake from breaking when rolling!?"
- "Since I received several messages telling me that they have failed to roll the cake, I added steps on how I roll the cake up on March 25, 2010.  It will be easier if you use a 30 cm baking tray."
- "This roll cake (in the photo on the right), I replaced 5 g of the cocoa powder with black cocoa powder. Looks bitter."
