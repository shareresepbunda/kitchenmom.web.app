Knead the dough for 6 to 8 minutes at medium speed in a stand mixer.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let it rise for 1 hour until the size has doubled.Once the dough has risen, punch it down. Then, divide the dough into 3.5 oz portions, roll into balls, and cover."
- "Let the balls of dough rest for 5 minutes before shaping the dough pieces into football-shaped rolls (tapering the dough toward the edges of each roll).The rolls should be 5 inches long and 2 inch wide at the center.Place the rolls onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, and cover with greased plastic. Allow the rolls to rise while turning the oven on and preheating it to 400°F.Use one egg, beaten, and 1 tablespoon of water to create your egg wash."
- "When the rolls are almost doubled in size, brush the tops and sides with the egg wash. Using a serrated knife, make two parallel slashes in the rolls. Bake for 20 to 22 minutes at 400°F until the rolls are golden brown. The centers should read 190°F on a thermometer. Remove the rolls from the oven, and cool completely."

Once the potatoes are cooked, add them to the skillet with the Fullblood Wagyu chorizo. Keep cooking for 3 minutes (this is just enough time to allow the flavors to blend and the potatoes to get a little more ten-der). Set aside."
- "Place the guajillo peppers, 1 cup of water (that the peppers were previously soaking in), garlic cloves, Mexican oregano, and peppercorns into a blender. Process the ingredients until you have a smooth sauce. This is your guajillo sauce.Strain the sauce, and place in a bowl.Heat a griddle, and add a 1/2 tablespoon of oil. Slice the telera rolls that you prepared earlier.Place the sliced rolls upside down on the griddle, and brush their tops all over with the guajillo sauce."
- "Flip the rolls so the tops get a little warm and crispy. Cook for a minute or two per side. Repeat the process with the rest of the rolls, adding oil to the griddle as needed."
