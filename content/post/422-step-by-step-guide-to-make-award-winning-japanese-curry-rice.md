Japanese curry is made out of a special roux which comprises of curry powder, flour, oil and other aromatics. It is then served with either udon (Japanese wheat noodles) or rice together with a selection of meat which may be braised or coated in breadcrumbs and fried (katsu). Japanese curry quickly became a sensation, and a thing all its own. Vegetables and basmati rice are cooked with curry powder that will pair so well with any chicken, beef or fish dish. They both made for a quick dinner that packs so much flavor and what I love is, since the vegetables are in the rice, this is the only side dish you need.
