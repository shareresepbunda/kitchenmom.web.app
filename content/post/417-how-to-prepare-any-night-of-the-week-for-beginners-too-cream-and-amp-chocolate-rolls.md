recipeinstructions:
- "If you are kneading the dough by hand (since the first rising will be done with the microwave), make the cream before making the dough."
- "Bring the egg and butter to room temperature."
- "Strain the egg through a strainer. 20 g will be used for making the dough and the remaining amount will be used later."
- "If you are using a bread maker, put all of the ingredients into the compartment and turn the switch on!"
- "Ok. Let&#39;s make the 2 variations of cream."
- "Please refer tofor making the custard cream."
- "So now it&#39;s time for the chocolate cream."
- "Combine all of the &#34;A&#34; ingredients. Sift and put into a heat-resistant bowl."
- "Microwave the &#34;B&#34; milk for 30 seconds at 1000W."
- "Add the &#34;B&#34; milk little by little to the bowl with the &#34;A&#34; ingredients, while continuously stirring."
- "Microwave Step 10 for 1 1/2 minutes at 1000W."
- "Remove and add in the &#34;C&#34; ingredients. Microwave for another 45 seconds at 1000W."
- "Remove from the microwave and stir well. Mix in the rum and it&#39;s done. You can place the bowl in ice water to help it cool."
- "Note: Both of the creams should be soft enough to roll up in the bread dough."
- "Once the bread maker has finished kneading the dough, check it with your finger! Coat your finger with flour and poke the dough. If the hole doesn&#39;t fill in, it&#39;s done rising!"
- "If the hole fills in after poking, then it&#39;s not done rising. Leave it for another 5 minutes."
- "If the entire ball of dough whithers, it&#39;s a sign of too much rising. Since you can&#39;t go back and fix it, resign yourself to a not-so-good end result and continue on!"
- "Use a scraper or something similar to remove the dough from the bread maker. Push the dough firmly with your fist to remove the gas."
- "Use a scale to precisely divide the dough into 6 portions. Use a scraper to cut the dough. Absolutely do not tear the dough."
- "Cover the dough with a damp towel or place it in a bread mat so that it doesn&#39;t dry out."
- "Release the gas by pushing from the center towards the edges of the dough. (Just enough to release the larger gas pockets is fine)"
- "Roll them into neat balls. Keep rolling them around until the dough becomes somewhat sticky."
- "Tightly pinch the back to hold it together."
- "Once they have all been rolled into balls, cover with a damp towel and let them sit for 15 minutes."
- "Place them with the seam facing up and release the gas one more time. Use a rolling pin them out to the size of 2 scrapers."
- "For the custard cream version, top 1/3 of the dough with 1 tbsp of custard cream."
- "For the chocolate cream version, top with the chocolate cream."
- "Fold the dough over so that it covers the cream and pinch the edges together tightly so that they blend in!"
- "Use a scraper to cut slices starting from the center. Cut about 5."
- "Fold the cut sections of dough over the cream covered section of dough."
- "Gently stretch out the cut sections of dough to pull over to the underside, and push them tightly so that the edges blend in."
- "Once they have all been shaped, let rise a second time in an oven preheated to 40°C."
- "POINT: If using a 2 layer oven, bake the dough and let it rise on the second rack. But if your oven is smaller and there&#39;s not a lot of space in between the layers, there&#39;s a possibility they will get stuck to the top rack."
- "After rising, they should plump up like in the picture."
- "Preheat the oven to 190°C for 12 minutes. Meanwhile, spread the leftover egg from making the dough over the surfaces."
- "Put them in the oven. The baking time will vary according to your oven, so adjust accordingly."
- "When they are removed from the oven, place on a cooling rack to cool and then they&#39;re done!"
