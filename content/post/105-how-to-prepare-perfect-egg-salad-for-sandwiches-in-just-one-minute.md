recipeinstructions:
- "Break the egg into a mug, and prick the yolk in several places with a fork.  It&#39;s a good idea to make lots of holes, until the egg yolk nearly falls apart."
- "Cover the mug lightly with plastic wrap (I use a cover), and microwave for one minute (at 500 W)."
- "I recommend microwaving it for 50 seconds first, and then microwaving it for an additional 10 seconds, rather than microwaving it for a full minute at once, so that it is less likely to explode."
- "Mash the egg in the mug with a fork."
- "Season with the mayonnaise, salt &amp; pepper."
- "Done! You can use it for tartar sauce as well as egg sandwiches."
- "Large eggs may take longer to cook. Microwave these for an additional 10 seconds at a time, checking for doneness."
