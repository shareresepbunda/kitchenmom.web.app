recipeingredient:
- "4 cups flour"
- "3 cups sugar"
- "2 cups chopped strawberries"
- "5 eggs"
- "1 stick butter"
- "1 1/2 tsp baking powder"
- "3/4 tsp vanilla extract"
- " Sherry I used Brandy as a substitute"
- "2 1/4 cups milk"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "2 cups water"
recipeinstructions:
- "For the custard:  In a bowl, mix 4 eggs with 1 1/4 tbl of sugar. Add the vanilla extract and mix. In a saucepan, heat 2 1/4 cups of milk. Do not boil, or it will curdle.  Once milk is hot, pour into egg mixture and stir while adding to the bowl.  Then, place entire bowl contents into the saucepan and heat - stirring constantly.  Stir until custard coats the back of your stirring spoon. Place in a container and set aside for now."
- "For the strawberry topping: Take the chopped strawberries and add 2 cups of water to a saucepan. Heat until mixture is a rolling boil.  Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Add 1 cup of sugar and bring to a rolling boil again.  Reduce heat and simmer for another 5 minutes - stirring often to dissolve sugar. Place in a container and set aside for now."
- "For the shortbread: Mix 1 stick of butter with 1/2 cup of sugar with a mixer or by hand. Add 1 cup of flour, 1/4 tsp of salt, and 1 tsp baking powder.  Add 1 egg and mix.  Chill in refrigerator for about 15 minutes. Take out of refrigerator and roll out on a flat surface.  Cut shortbread into small round shapes using a cookie cutter or an upside down wine glass. Place onto a greased cookie sheet and bake in oven at 400 degrees. Bake for about 10 minutes. Cookies should just be turning a slight golden color around the edges."
- "Making the trifle: Take a tall glass (I only have maurgarita glasses).  Crumble one of the shortbread cookies into the bottom of the glass. Pour sherry over the crumbled cookie until it absorbs all the alcohol. Pour the custard over this. Place another shortbread cookienover the top. Pour the strawberry topping over this. If desired, put whipped cream on top. Garnish with strawberry. Note: You may add as many layers as you like - depending on how tall your glass is."
