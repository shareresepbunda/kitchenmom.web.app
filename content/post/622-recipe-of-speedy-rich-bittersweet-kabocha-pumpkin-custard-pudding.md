recipeinstructions:
- "Make the caramel sauce. Put the sugar and water in a sauce pan and put over high heat. You will see the sugar is gradually dissolving. Do not stir at this point and keep an eye on the sauce pan."
- "The sugar starts to change its colour. Turn down the heat to low and rotate the pan. When white smoke starts to come out and it becomes fragrant, turn off the heat."
- "After tuning off the heat, the sugar syrup will get dark brown with remaining heat. Add the hot water and be careful because the caramel spits."
- "Cut the pumpkin into large chunks with the skin on and heat in a microwave for 3 minutes. After this it is easier to peel the skin."
- "Peel the skin with a vegetable peeler or knife."
- "Cut into small slices and make sure that you have 300 g of pumpkin flesh."
- "Put the prepared pumpkin into a bowl and heat in a microwave for 3 minutes. Remove from the microwave and mash the pumpkin. Repeat this process three times and you will have a fluffy tender pumpkin mash. Use a spoon to mash roughly."

- "Put the pumpkin, eggs, sugar, milk and heavy cream into a mixer. Blend for 5 seconds and repeat several times."
- "Strain the custard pudding mixture through a sieve into a bowl."
- "Pour the caramel into a 18-cm mould while still hot and leave to cool. Ladle the custard pudding mixture into the mould."
- "Scrape the rest from the bowl into the mould with a plastic spatula. Set the mould in a baking tray filled with hot water and bake in the oven pre-heated to 170째C or 338째F for 50 minutes."
- "It is ready. Leave to cool slightly after removing from the oven and chill in the fridge."
- "After 3 to 4 hours place large serving plate on top of the pudding and flip over. You need a slightly deep dish so the caramel doesn&#39;t overflow."
- "Serve with plenty of caramel for your tea time."
- "There are a lot of process photos but the process itself is easy. Blitz in a mixer and strain the mixture through a sieve. It is easy and quick."
