- "Make filling: Steam the egg yolks for 10 minutes, then mash them into fine crumbs. In a medium bowl, beat the butter until softened. Add the yolks and the remaining ingredients. Mix until smooth. Cover and refrigerate to firm for about 45 minutes."
- "Divide the filling into 16 equal portions (about 11g each). Roll each into a smooth round ball. Keep them in the fridge until needed."
- "To make dough: In a medium bowl, make a well on the center of flour. Add sugar into the center. Then pour half of the hot water onto the sugar to melt it."
- "Stir everything until combined. Then gradually add more hot water as you mix, until the dough is smooth and not too dry or too sticky. If you overpour water and the dough becomes sticky, add a little more flour to fix the consistency."
- "Knead the oil into the dough until well combined. Cover and let it sit for 10 to 30 minutes."
- "Divide the rested dough into 16 balls. Cover the dough whenever possible so it does not dry out."
- "Flatten each dough ball, add custard filling onto the center, then wrap up until the filling is tightly sealed. Roll in between your palms to make a smooth ball."
- "Dip the ball into a bowl of water for one second. Transfer it into the bowl of sesame seeds to coat. Gently press to secure the seeds."
- "Preheat enough cooking oil in a deep pot to 350째F or 180째C. Test fry with 1 sesame ball to determine the correct cooking time. The filling can spill out when overcooked so stand-by. Rotate the ball frequently to get an even-cook. It will brown slightly once done (mine took less than 8 minutes). Transfer to a plate lined with paper towel to catch any dripping oil. Continue frying the rest. Then serve while still warm."
