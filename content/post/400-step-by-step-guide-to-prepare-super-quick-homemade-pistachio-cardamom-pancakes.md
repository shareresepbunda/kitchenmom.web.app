recipeinstructions:
- "We will prepare the toasted fruit and nut first. In a mortar and pestle gently crush the almonds &amp; cashews"
- "To a frying pan add some butter. Toast the crushed almonds, cashews, dried cranberries, sultanas and raisins. Allow them to brown a little but don&#39;t over cook them or else they will taste burnt. This step allows the dried fruit and nut to soften and take a roasted flavour."
- "Once done set then aside on a paper towel to soak off the excess fat."
- "We will prepare the sauce in a sauce pan, place the sauce pan on medium heat and add your milk or heavy cream. If you prefer a more syrup consistency go for double cream. Add a tablespoon of butter, a heaping table spoon of brown sugar (normal sugar is fine too) and 1 shot of dark spiced rum (the less alcohol the better)"
- "Allow the sauce to heat up and rise, stirring occasionally. Boil till all the alcohol has evaporated and if you&#39;ve used cream thicken to required consistency. Milk will not get thick so boil till alcohol evaporates."
- "Once done take it off the heat and set it aside to cool. Place cling wrap touching the surface of the sauce. This will prevent a skin from forming on the top. Put in fridge to chill."
- "We will prepare the batter now. Remove the cardamom seeds from its pods and using a mortar pestle pound it into a powder."
- "In a large mixing bowl combine all the dry ingredients first : 2/3 cups flour, 1/3 cup pistachio meal, cardamom powder, 1 teaspoon baking powder, cardamom powder, sugar and a pinch of salt. Mix well using a whisk till all thoroughly mixed."
- "Add the wet ingredients : a whole egg and 1:1 ratio of buttermilk to flour ratio. Mix well till a thick batter forms."
- "In a frying pan over medium heat, add some butter and ladel in desired size pancake. Cook till you see small bubbles rising to the top and that means it&#39;s cooked 1/2 through, try and release the pancake from the bottom of the pan before flipping."
- "Once all pancakes are done, assemble your stack, top with fresh banana, toasted fruit and nut mix and our rum sauce. Gently dust powdered sugar over top for aesthetics."
