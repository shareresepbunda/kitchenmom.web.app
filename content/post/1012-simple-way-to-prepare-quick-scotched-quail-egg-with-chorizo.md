recipeingredient:
- "12 x quail eggs"
- "3 x plain pork sausage 8s"
- " equal amount of soft not cooked chorizo sausage"
- "1 x tbsp chopped chives or other herb of your choice"
- "2 x regular eggs for the crumbing"
- "200 g approx plain flour for crumbing"
- "1 x pack of savoury seeded biscuits for crumbing blitzed to dust"
- " neutral oil for deep frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "For the sausage blanket around the egg, peel the chorizo and plain sausage and then chop the herbs"
- "Blitz the chorizo first to break it down then add the plain sausage and blend until you achieve a fairly smooth mixture, turn into a bowl and stir in the chives."
- "To cook the eggs accurately add them very carefully to a pan of rapid boiling water, I use a spider, or you can place them in a pan and pour over the boiling water? Boil rapidly for 2 minutes and 20 seconds then immediately either submerge in iced water or just leave under a running cold tap for a minute or so. To peel them, tap on a work surface and start at the flat bottom end as there is an air pocket there, try to peel very gently. I know my timer says 2 mins I had to count to 20 after."
- "Take a piece of sausage mix about the same size as the egg and with damp hands (keep a small bowl of water next to you) press the mixture into a rough circle about 4mm thick, sit an egg in the centre and carefully bring the edges around and together. Keep manipulating CAREFULLY until it is completely encased."
- "To finish the wrapped egg with damp hands just roll it between your palms until it looks like the first image. the next image is my pane station, flour beaten egg and crumbs, 1. dust in flour and remove excess, have a slotted spoon ready for the egging."
- "Dip into the beaten egg, use the slotted spoon to remove and try to let the excess egg drip off. Roll in the crumb and then to add an additional layer of crumb, go back into the egg and finally the crumbs again."
- "Heat your veg or other neutral oil to about 180c, if you don&#39;t have a thermometer add a small pea sized piece of sausage mix to it and if it bubbles away your there. Lower in the eggs in batches so the oil doesn&#39;t rise too much or cool down, I did 3 at a time. Fry for 3 mins exactly, remove to a plate lined with kitchen paper. PLEASE BE SO CAREFUL"
- "Allow the eggs at least 10 minutes to cool before tucking in, I like them at room temp but are very nice chilled, I also love salad cream with mine, not very classy I know but who cares?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2JVvh-X4qo&amp;t=157s. these images are taken from my youtube channel feel free to pay me a visit there, consider subscribing also it&#39;s free x"
