- "Strain the mixture and press out all of the juice. Discard the solid chunks. Refrigerate the juice overnight (or up to 5 days). The juice will separate into 2 layers: clearer liquid on its top and concentrated extract on its bottom."
- "On the next day, slowly pour out and discard the clear liquid. Add milk into the concentrated extract and stir well. Set aside."

- "Gradually add sugar as you mix. Continue beating until it reaches a stiff peak stage."
- "Mix in 1/3 of beaten egg white into the cake batter using a spatula or a hand whisk. Then add another 1/3 of egg white. From here on, we want to gently combine the mixture. Be careful not to deflate the batter. The air inside this fluffy meringue is the key component of a fluffy cake. Mix just until no white streaks are seen."
- "Add the remaining egg white. Mix again just until combined."
- "Pour batter into the prepared pan. Swirl the batter with a wooden stick to remove any big bubbles inside. Tap the pan twice onto the counter to further remove air bubbles. Place the pan inside another larger pan. Fill the larger pan with hot water halfway up the height of cake batter."
- "Bake in a preheated oven at 300°F (150°C) for 55-65 minutes. Once baked, immediately remove from the water bath and drop the cake pan 2 times onto the counter. Let it cool for 5 minutes or until the cake comes away from the pan. Then invert the cake pan to unmold the cake. Let cool completely."
