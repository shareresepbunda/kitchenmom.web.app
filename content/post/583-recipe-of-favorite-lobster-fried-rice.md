Lobster Fried Rice is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals on earth. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes delicious. It's appreciated by millions daily. They are fine and they look wonderful. Lobster Fried Rice is something that I have loved my entire life.

Adding the lobster meat to the rice before serving is key to this dish. This is accomplished in minutes with a watchful eye and a couple of turns in the wok. As the meat cooks evenly in the bed of warm rice, it drops more lobster juice which evaporates and imbues the fried rice with even more lobster flavor. Heat a skillet or wok over medium high heat and add sesame oil.
