- "Bake about 30 minutes, until the top feels firmer."
- "You can drain some of the grease now if you want, we tilt the pan and hold the loaf with a paper towel. Then spread plenty of the ketchup mix on top, and bake for another 15 minutes."
- "Of course, if it doesn&#39;t seem cooked through, it can easily take more time."
- "Give it maybe ten extra minutes to cool, and enjoy!"
