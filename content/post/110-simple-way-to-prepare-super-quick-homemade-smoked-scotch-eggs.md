recipeingredient:
- "2 x 1 lbs ground pork or turkey sausage or other ground protein"
- "10 eggs 8 boiled and 2 if breading in Step 10"
- " Optional"
- " Bread crumbs plain or seasoned"
- " BBQ Seasoning"
- " Other spices or seasonings"
recipeinstructions:
- "Gather all ingredients along with a cutting board and 3 or 4 mixing bowls."
- "Prepare 8 boiled eggs to your desired preference, place in ice bath and set aside. Recommend cooking eggs to soft or medium boiled stage because eggs will likely cook further when encased in sausage on the grill. Refrigerate eggs for an hour or overnight if possible to minimize them cooking while on the grill."
- "Preheat pellet grill or smoker to 300°-350° F and your desired smoke level. These can also be baked in the oven at 350°."
- "Slice each pound of sausage into 4 equal portions (about 2.25 slices wide if using the marks on the package indicating 10 slices/lb)."
- "Flatten each sausage piece as much as possible. The closer the sausage is to room temperature, the easier it will be to manipulate. The larger the diameter of your sausage, the easier it will be to cover the egg."
- "Peel the eggs and pat dry. The sausage will adhere better to the dry egg."
- "Place an egg in the center of each flattened sausage patty and begin pulling the sausage up and around the egg and pinching the seams together to completely encase it. Continue turning the sausage/egg ball in your hands, pinching and sealing as you go. Try to cover the egg evenly in sausage. Do this for all 8 eggs and patties before moving on to the next step."
- "If you want a simple sausage and egg Scotch Egg, move to Step 12"
- "Here are some ways to jazz up your Scotch Eggs before cooking:"
- "Breaded Scotch Eggs: Whisk 2 eggs and set aside; pour 1 cup of bread crumbs into a bowl and set aside; dip 1 sausage/egg ball into the egg and then into the bread crumbs, coating completely; Repeat to bread up to 4 Scotch Eggs."
- "Seasoned Scotch Eggs: Lightly cover the sausage/egg balls in your favorite BBQ seasoning. Remember that most sausage is already well salted and seasoned, so be careful not to over season in this step. A little BBQ seasoning goes a long way on sausage. For breakfast sausage, consider a pork rub with more sugar and less salt content. Pit Boss makes a Tennessee Apple Butter seasoning that I will try next time."
- "Place Scotch Eggs on a grill rack or in a roasting pan on a sheet of parchment paper to prevent sticking. Cook for 30 minutes, then check meat temp with instant read meat probe. You are looking for 165° internal temp for any ground meat to be done."
- "At 165°, remove from grill and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving. Eat them as is or consider serving with maple syrup or a dijon-mayo or maybe spice then up with siracha sauce or a siracha-mayo. Enjoy!"
