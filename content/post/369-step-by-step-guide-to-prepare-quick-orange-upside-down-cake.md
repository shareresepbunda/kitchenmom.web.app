- "Orange syrup: Heat orange juice and sugar over medium heat until sugar is dissolved. Simmer orange slices in the syrup until tender for about 10 minutes."

- "To make homemade buttermilk (skip to the next step if you have buttermilk): Combine 85 ml milk with 1 tsp lemon juice or distilled white vinegar. Let it sit for 10 minutes before using. The mixture will slightly curd and thicken by itself."
