- "Add the milk some at a time while whisking, making sure there are no lumps."

- "Beat one egg with one tablespoon of water. Brush lightly each pastry cone with the egg wash."

- "Bake at 400°F (200 °C) for about 15-20 minutes until golden on top."
- "Let them cool down for a couple of minutes and gently remove from the mold. If the pastry sticks to the mold, you can press in the mold a little (to make the circumference smaller) and very gently turn it inside the pastry until it comes off."
- "Before serving, fill with the cream using a piping bag. Sprinkle with powdered sugar if you like, and enjoy!"
