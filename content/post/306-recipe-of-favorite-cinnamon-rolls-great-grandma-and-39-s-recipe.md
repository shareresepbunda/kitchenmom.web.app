recipeingredient:
- " 2 Cups Milk"
- " 34 Cup honey"
- " 2 Eggs"
- " 1 Tsp salt"
- " 78 Cups flour"
- " 2 12 Tsp yeast"
- " 3 Sticks butter room temperature To be separated"
- " 14 Cup warm water 120130 degrees Fahrenheit"
- " 1 Tsp sugar"
- " 2 12 Cups powdered sugar"
- " 2 Tsp vanilla extract"
- " 12 Cup butter"
- " 2 12 Tbsp milk"
- " 12 Cup cinnamon"
- " 1 12 Cup sugar"
- " 1 Cup raisens"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a medium pan add the 2 cups of milk. Heat just until it reaches 130 degrees Fahrenheit. Turn heat off. Add 1/2 stick butter and the honey. Mix well. Check temperature making sure it is at or below 130 degrees Fahrenheit. If it is, add the 2 eggs (The point here is not to be so hot that it cooks the eggs but warm enough to desolve the butter and honey). Mix well. Set aside for a minute."
- "In a large bowl add 3 cups of flour and 2 Tsp Salt. Set aside."
- "In a small bowl add 1/4 cup 120-130 degrees Fahrenheit water, the yeast and 1 tsp sugar. Mix well. Let froth 5 minutes."
- "Add the milk mixture to the bowl of flour. Add the yeast mixture on top of that. Beat with paddle attachment for 3 minutes. Replace paddle with dough hook. While it is kneading add remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time. Very important not to use to much flour. You want the dough ball a tad moist, not to dry. When you have dough the right consistency continue kneading on medium speed for 10 minutes."
- "Grease a large baking pan with butter and set aside."
- "Grease a large bowl with butter. Remove dough ball from mixer to a floured surface. Knead into a nice ball. Grease hands with butter, and throughly grease the dough ball. Set inside large greased bowl. Wash hands, cover dough with plastic wrap."
- "Let rise 1 hour. Until doubled."
- "Remove dough to a floured surface and knead 5 or so minutes. Form back into a ball. Grease well with butter. Replace back into large bowl. Wash hands and cover dough with plastic wrap."
- "Let rise again until doubled. About 40 minutes."
- "Place on floured surface. Knead a few times. With a rolling pin, flatten and shape into a nice rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Spread 1 stick of the softened butter over the whole top."
- "Mix 1 1/2 Cups sugar, the 3/4 cup cinnamon in a small bowl. Sprinkle half of this mixture over the buttered dough. Add the raisens evenly over that."
- "Roll dough toward you evenly until it is a nice long tube. Now either measure or guess like I do and slice roll into 12 even circles. You don&#39;t want the large pan over filled so use ur judgement cutting the rolls to size. l usually have leftover dough,which I use later."
- "Place the 12 rolls side by side in the greased pan. With a brush spread a stick of the softened butter over the tops of the rolls. Over that spread evenly the remaining sugar/cinnamon mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled. About 30 minutes."
- "Pre heat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit."
- "Remove plastic wrap. Place rolls in oven. Bake 40 minutes."
- "Place a clean cloth over a cutting board. (I do this for ease of clean up.)"
- "When done remove pan of rolls from oven. Turn pan upside down on to clothed board. Remove pan leaving rolls. And being careful not to burn urself. I&#39;ve done that more than once."
- "Let cool 30 minutes."
- "Mix the powdered sugar, 2 Tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 cup butter and the 2 1/2 Tbsp milk in mixer with wire whip attachment."
- "Spoon/spread over the cooled rolls,top and sides. Enjoy!"
