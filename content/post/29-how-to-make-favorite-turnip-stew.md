- "Cut chili’s, smash and peel garlic and add dried onion to olive oil and slowly cook to infuse the oil with flavors."
- "Add oil, canned tomato and all sausages to pot. Season generously and allow to boil. Unless you have a massive pot, you’ll have to let the water reduce before adding the veggies. It’s not a terrible thing. The boiling sausage will become tender and add to the flavor of the stew."
- "Once the liquid has reached a level where it won’t have surface tension issues, add in the veggies. Simmer gently, uncovered and stirring occasionally."
- "Do a fork test and poke the veggies. When they’re about half way don’t me, add in the boiled eggs. Why boiled eggs? Why not? Haha. Once the veggies are fork tender, add in the green onion and cook another 4-5 minutes."
- "Hopefully you’ve cooked your pasta during all of that simmering. Spoon the stew right over the pasta. Will also work with rice."
