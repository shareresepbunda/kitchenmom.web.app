- "Line a loaf pan with parchment paper; set aside. Preheat an oven to 170℃ / 338F. Cut butter into small pieces, and microwave it at 500 W for 50 sec to melt. Add milk to the butter, and stir roughly; set aside."
- "Chop white chocolate, and put it into a bowl. Boil water with a small pot. The amount of water is the amount that the bottom of the bowl doesn&#39;t touch the hot water when the chocolate bowl is placed on."
- "Bring to a boil, turn off the heat. Place the bowl &#39;&#39;with chocolate&#39;&#39; so that it doesn&#39;t touch the hot water. Wait 30 seconds as it is, and then melt it until smooth. Takedown the bowl."
- "Pour the hot water of the pot into the frying pan, heat it on low heat, set aside. Put eggs in a bowl, and beat it lightly until watery. Add granulated sugar, stir roughly. Warm it with hot water until 35℃ / 95 F (body temperature) while stirring on low heat."
- "Take the egg out from the hot water, and turn off the heat, leave the melted butter and milk put in. Add the egg to the chocolate in 4 parts, stir each time."

- "Pour into the loaf pan. Pour plenty of 50℃ / 122 F hot water into a baking tray, and place the pan in. If you mix water and boiling water in the same ratio, it reaches about 50℃ / 122 F."
- "Bake it at 150℃ / 302 F for 27-30 mins. Bake until the surface is omelet-colored and dry. Let it cool completely, cover the pan with plastic wrap, refrigerate overnight."
- "Lift the parchment paper to take out the cake. If the cake doesn&#39;t lift, warm the pan with hot water for 30-50 sec, and then take it out. Use the warmed knife to cut smooth and cleanly. Top each with whipped cream, done! If you take it out of the refrigerator and leave it at room temperature for about 20 minutes, it will get softer and smoother."
