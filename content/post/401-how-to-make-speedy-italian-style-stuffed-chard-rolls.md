recipeingredient:
- "1 bunch Swiss Chard"
- "3 tbsp olive oil extra virgin"
- "1 large onion minced"
- "1 large carrot finely minced"
- "1 large rib of celery minced"
- "2 tbsp salt"
- "2 tbsp granulated garlic"
- "1/4 tbsp Italian red pepper flakes"
- "1 large handful of basil minced"
- "1 handful of Italian parsley chopped"
- "6 large button mushrooms sliced"
- "16 oz ricotta"
- "2 large eggs lightly beaten"
- "2 quart marinara sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and de-rib the chard."
- "The chard goes into salted boiling water for a blanch, and then into ice water to cool."
- "Heat the oil on low in a 2 or 3 qt saucepan, and then chop and toss in the chard ribs."
- "Add the onion, carrot, celery, salt, garlic, and red pepper flake into the mix, and let it cook down for about 5 minutes."
- "Now toss in the basil, parsley, and mushrooms, and stir and let that all marry in for another 5-7 minutes."
- "When the mix has cooked down quite a bit, add in the ricotta, and let that cook in for a few more minutes."
- "Then, remove the saucepan from heat, and let the mix cool for a good 15min."
- "While you wait for the mix to cool a bit, carefully pull the deribbed leaves out one by one, and then cut them into rollable sizes, at least about 4-5in across and 6 or 7in long, ideally."

- "Now that the mix has cooled to a temp lower than egg-cooking temperature, add the beaten eggs to the mix and stir."
- "OK, burrito-style, roll the chard leaves with about 2 tablespoons (on average) of the mix, and then place the rolls in a large 9x17in casserole dish with a light layer of marinara lining the bottom.  Be smart about the mix, adjust the amount of mix to the size of the leaf wrapper.  If you need to layer, make sure another thin layer of marinara goes over the first layer before creating a second layer."
- "Put a layer of marinara on the top layer, and then seal the casserole dish up with aluminum foil."
- "Pop it in the oven at 375°F for about 45min."
- "Serve with a little extra marinara on top, and maybe some pecorino Romano cheese, and a fork and knife."
