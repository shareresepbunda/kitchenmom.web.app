- "1 tsp White Distilled Vinegar"
- "1 packages Precooked Canadian Bacon 8 pieces"
- "1 packages Knorr Hollandaise Sauce Mix"

- "1 Metal Slotted Spoon"
- "1 Serrated Knife"
- "2 small Pots"
- "1 Whisk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Don&#39;t cut the English Muffins in half as you usually would. Just slightly shave off the top dusty portion of the muffin with a serrated knife. Toast well and spread butter on serrated side. By slightly shaving off the tops you&#39;ll end up with a thicker, more absorbant muffin that still has that same toasted, crispy outer layer most enjoy."
- "Place a small amount of Hollandaise sauce on top of your buttered muffin. Just enough to cover the top."
- "Place 2 pieces of Canadian Bacon on top of your sauce."
- "Place poached egg on top of your Canadian Bacon."
- "Top with Hollandaise sauce and sprinkle with Cayenne Pepper and fresh chives."
- "FOR HOLLANDAISE SAUCE: Place 1 cup milk and 1/4 cup butter in pot and bring to a simmer. Add Knorrs Hollandaise packet and black pepper and briskly stir with a whisk."
- "FOR POACHED EGGS: Gently crack open 4 eggs and place into individual ramakin bowls. This step is necessary for the security of your yolks. Bring 4&#34; water to a boil then add 1 teaspoon white vinager. Gently add 2 eggs to the water. Boil for 2 1/2 minutes. Gently remove eggs with a slotted spoon. Leave the egg on your spoon and daub on a paper towel to dry for a second or two and gently place on muffin."
- "You can also try my 35 second poached egg recipe to save even more time.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/353221-mikes-35-second-poached-eggs"
- "Repeat for the other 2 eggs."
- "TIP: If making more than 2 servings, [especially for larger groups] for times sake, you can poach your eggs for 2 1/2 minutes then gently place in a large bowl filed with water and mostly ice. Let them set until you&#39;re ready to serve. When ready, gently place them back into your boiling water for a few seconds [never leaving your slotted spoon] and viola, you still have perfect, timely poached eggs!"
