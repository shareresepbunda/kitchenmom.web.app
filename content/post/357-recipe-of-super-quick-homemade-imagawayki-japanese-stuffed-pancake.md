recipeinstructions:
- "Azuki bean filling: place drained azuki beans, light brown sugar and tiny bit salt into a milk pan. (Here I used a tin of Tesco azuki bean, but you can also cook the beans from scratch.) Simmer it until the beans absorb all the sugar. (Keep stirring during the cooking.) Leave aside to cool down before the use."
- "Custard buttercream filling: mix egg yolk, sugar, flour ingredients and vanilla extract all together. Get a milk pan to heat up the milk and then pour the milk into the egg yolk bowl and combine them well. Pour all the mixture back into the milk pan and cook the mixture until it gets thicker. Place the custard into a bowl and cover by clinging film and leave it in the fridge to cool down completely."
- "Before use, take the custard out from the fridge. Use a wooden spoon to stir it a bit. Add in soften unsalted butter and combine them by using an electric mixer."
- "Pancake batter: mix egg, sugar and salt together. Pour in milk and water. Add in sieved flour ingredients and mix them well. Pour in the vegetable oil and make sure all are combined together. Leave the batter aside for 60 minutes before using it."
- "Heat the mould pan and pour in proper amount of batter. Use a round head stick to even the batter to form a cup shape. Put in some filling. Use a skewer to pick up a cup and place it on the one with filling like a sandwich. Keep turn the pancakes until they turn golden brown on both sides. Enjoy~ üòã"
