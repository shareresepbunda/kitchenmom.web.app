- "When the oil is ready, turn the heat up to medium-high and carefully slip in the wings, adding just enough so that there&#39;s still plenty of space around each wing."

- "Make the spicy honey butter: While the chicken is frying, in a bowl, whisk together the melted butter, Cholula, honey, and salt until incorporated. Taste and add more salt if necessary."
- "Slather the wings with the spicy honey butter and serve."
- "For oven roasted sweet potato wedges:  Preheat oven to 200ºC.  Heat oil on large shallow baking pan in oven until very hot, but not smoking, about 10 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, beat egg whites in large bowl with electric mixer on medium-high until stiff peak form. Gently stir in seasoned salt until combined. Add sweet potatoes; toss to coat well."
- "Remove baking pan from oven, being careful not to spill hot oil. Arrange the sweet potatoes in a single layer, flat side down, on baking pan."
- "Roast 25 - 30 minutes or until sweet potatoes are tender and lightly browned, turning halfway through cooking. Sprinkle with additional seasoned salt, if desired."
