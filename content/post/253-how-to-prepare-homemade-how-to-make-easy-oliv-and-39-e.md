- " medium potatoes"

- " large eggs"
- " small pickled cucumbers"
- " Small of can green peas"
- " Cilantro dill green onions"
- " Sour cream or mayonnaise"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all the ingredients to boil and turn the heat off when everything is cooked. Discard the shell from eggs. I also like to peel the carrots before they go into cooking. Potatoes, on the other hand, I wash thoroughly and leave the skin intact for cooking. I peel the skin off after the potatoes are cooked. Leaving the skin on keeps the potatoes in one piece, even when slightly overcooked and potatoes actually taste much better when cooked with skin."
- "Dice all the ingredients. I dice the carrots a little smaller than I would potatoes. Put all the ingredients in a large bowl."
- "Dice eggs as big as you would potatoes. You need to feel the taste of eggs in this salad."
- "Add 2 Tbps mayo, salt and pepper as you wish and slowly mix the salad"
