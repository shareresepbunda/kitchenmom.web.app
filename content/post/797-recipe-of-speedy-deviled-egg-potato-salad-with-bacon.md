- " paprika"
- " salt"
- " pepper"
- " salt for cooking the potatoes"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook potatoes whole skin on in a pot with salt until tender when fork is inserted. Mine took about 20 minutes. Drain and let cool enough to handle to peal them. Once peeled let them cool to close to room temp so they don&#39;t fall apart when you slice them. When they are cool cut them in half length wise then the halves cut them length wise again. Then slice them in about 1/4 to 1/2 inch slices. You want them a little thicker to keep them from mashing when you mix it all up"
- "Cut up the bacon in small chunks and fry it up nice and brown and set aside"
- "Cook your eggs. Put them in a pot and add salt to make them easier to peel. Add water and cook on stove. Once they start boiling set timer to 10 minutes. After 10 minutes pull them off and let them rinse under cold water for 5 minutes. Peel and dice them up. (tip. The more salt the easier it is to peel the shell off. The salt will not soak into the shell so don&#39;t worry about that)"
- "In a bowl add the eggs, mayo, mustard, paprika, and pepper and mix it up real good. It&#39;s going to be a bit thin. You want that. Now try the mix and add more mayo or mustard to your preferred taste."
- "Once you have the mix the way you like add the bacon and mix it in. Them dump it on the potatoes in a large bowl and carefully stir it all together being careful not to break the potatoes down too much."
- "Cover and set in fridge for a couple hours to let the flavors blend and it all to cool off nicely."
