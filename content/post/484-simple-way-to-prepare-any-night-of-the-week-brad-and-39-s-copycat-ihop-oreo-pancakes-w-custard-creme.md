recipeinstructions:
- "Heat milk in a saucepan on medium low heat. Stir often."
- "Place the rest of the custard ingredients, except butter, in a mixing bowl. Whisk until mixed well."
- "When milk starts to get bubbly, careful not to scald it, remove from heat. Slowly drizzle milk into the egg mixture to temper the eggs. Continue until all of the milk is incorporated."
- "Return to the pan and cook on medium low until mixture starts to thicken. Whisk constantly at this point. It will only take a few seconds after it starts bubbling for it to thicken. Once it thickens, remove from heat and whisk in softened butter."
- "Transfer mixture to a bowl. Allow to cool a bit. At this point you can either chill this in the fridge, or serve it without chilling. It is up to you. But either way, cover with saran wrap. Press down onto the custard surface. This prevents a skin from forming on it."
- "Next, mix your pancake mix. The mix I used called for 3/2. Mix/water. Mix it a little thinner than normal. It will thicken when the cookies are added."
- "Place cookies in a ziplock bag. Remove air. Crush with a rolling pin or mallet. The size of the crush is up to you. It can be course or fine. Mix into pancake batter."
- "Heat a pan for the pancakes. Just under medium heat. I used a cast iron griddle. Before cooking each cake, add butter to pan. Cook pancakes to desired size and doneness."
- "I did the double stack. Spread custard in between pancakes. Douse with syrup over top. Add another large dollop of custard on top and garnish with a cookie. Serve immediately. Enjoy."
