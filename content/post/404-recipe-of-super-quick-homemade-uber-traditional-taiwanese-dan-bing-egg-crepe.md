recipeinstructions:

- "Crepes making :  Heat a nonstick pan to medium heat. Pour a thin layer of crepe batter to the pan. Move the pan around to let it thin out. Cook for about 45-60 seconds then you will see the crepe is a bit brown on the edge and flip it over for around 30 secs."
- "Make-Ahead Crepes:  I usually make 20 pieces of crepe and freeze them for use. Place a stack of cooked, cooled crepes (between layers of wax paper or paper towels) inside a heavy-duty zip-top plastic bag then freeze in the refrigerator."
- "Dan-Bing Making: Heat a nonstick pan to medium heat. Mix ingredients you would like with an egg and pour a thin layer of the egg mixture to the pan. Move the pan around to let it thin out."
- "Put the frozen or fresh crepe on the top and carefully press it with a spatula for sticking. Then flip it over so that it returns to egg side up and add some salt and black pepper for seasoning. Add any topping you would like."
- "Roll the crepe into a long, rectangular roll. Cut into sections and serve hot with soy paste or sweet chilli sauce."
