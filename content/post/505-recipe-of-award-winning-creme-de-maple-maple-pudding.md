- " Creme Chantilly"
- "150 ml Heavy cream leftover from the pudding mixtureB"
- "12 grams Granulated sugarB"
- "4 ml Maple syrupB"
recipeinstructions:
- "Take the eggs out of the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before starting to make the pudding mixture."
- "Put all the A ingredients in a pan.  Cook over low heat stirring occasionally until the maple sugar dissolves completely. When the mixture reaches about 40-50 ℃, remove the pan from the heat."
- "Cool the mixture from Step 2 to about 30℃. If the mixture is too warm, the egg will form lumps.  Cooling the mixture too much is not good either.  Make sure to cool it to about 30℃."
- "Combine the egg yolk and the whole egg with a whisk taking care not to make it foamy. Tilt the bowl and move the whisk in straight lines as though you are &#34;cutting&#34; the egg white."
- "Gradually add the mixture from Step 3 into the Step 4 eggs stirring constantly with a whisk.  Once all the mixture is added, stir it well."
- "Strain the mixture from Step 5 through a fine strainer at least once . The egg white has small lumps which will change  the smoothness of the final product, so always strain the mixture."
- "Pour the Step 6 mixture into a heatproof container.  I strain the mixture into a measuring cup before adding it to a container."
- "Strain again from the measuring cup to the heatproof container."
- "This mini ramekin holds 55 ml of the mixture. (Ramekin size: 6 cm diameter x 5.8 cm height)."
- "Cover the containers with aluminum foil.  * If the container has a lid, use it to cover the container."
- "Pour some boiling water into a baking tray, place the containers from Step 10 into it and steam bake in a 160℃ oven for 20 minutes.  Reduce the temperature to 140℃ and bake for another 25 minutes."
- "The cooking time varies by the size of the container and the oven that you are using.  For reference, the mini ramekins from Step 9 took 15 minutes at 160℃ and 13 minutes in 130℃."
- "I have explained how to steam bake in the oven here.  If you prefer to steam the pudding on the stove, refer to the &#34;Puko chan&#39;s recipe&#34;."
- "See my recipe blog for how to steam food in &#34;Staub Mini Round Cocotte&#34;. (Japanese only)"
- "&#34;Once a film forms on the surface and the mixture does not fall apart when you tilt the container&#34; or &#34;the center of the pudding jiggles when you gently shake the container&#34; is the perfect time to remove it from the heat."
- "This is the perfect pudding described in Step 15.  This is fresh from oven and barely solid. It is very smooth and creamy."
- "This is the cross section. The texture is in between a thick cream and solid, but it is set. The bottom part has a creamier texture."
- "This is after refrigerating the pudding for 2 hours.  It is creamy, but has a much more solid texture than the texture of Step 17&#39;s pudding."
- "The heat of my electric oven is rather weak.  Check the state  after cooking for 15 minutes at 140℃. If the state is as shown in Steps 15 to 17,  the pudding is done."
- "If the pudding is not quite done, add more boiling water to the baking tray and bake it while checking every 5 minutes. If you are making this recipe for the first time, boil some water while baking the pudding."
- "Be careful to not overcook as wonderful texture will be ruined.  It may seem loose right out of the oven, but it will solidify while chilling."
- "Cool the pudding from Step 15 to room temperature.  Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and chill completely in the refrigerator."
- "Chill the pudding for more than 8 hours and it is done.  Drizzle on some maple syrup and enjoy."
- "My goal was to make a copy-cat recipe of the &#34;Appalaches Maple Pudding&#34; from the sweets store &#34;Le Chocolatier Takagi&#34;."
- "This is the &#34;Appalaches Maple Pudding&#34;.  This pudding is genius  It comes with maple syrup to pour on."
- "The pudding is topped with smooth and creamy crème Chantilly. It is super delicious and I love it. Now back to my recipe..."
- "When the pudding from Step 22 is chilled for about 1-2 hours, add all the B ingredients in a bowl and beat until soft peaks form. Spread evenly onto the pudding."
- "Chill the pudding again for at least 5 hours.  I like the texture after chilling it overnight."
- "Look how perfect it is! It is delicious enough as it is, but you can drizzle  on some maple syrup for an even nicer touch."
- "This is the top layer. The hardened creme Chantilly, the pudding and the maple syrup are exquisite."
- "Next, you will encounter the smooth and creamy pudding layer. The maple syrup coats the pudding and melts in your mouth."
- "And then comes the even creamier pudding layer. It is almost a cream-like pudding that melts in your mouth."
- "And the bottom layer is a thick and smooth cream layer. It&#39;s great eating this luxurious custard cream."
- "These multiple textures give different enjoyments at each layer. Please enjoy this patisserie quality &#34;Crème de Maple&#34;."
- "See an easy standard custard pudding recipe that you can make with ingredients on hand at (Recipe ID 1868649): &#34;Mama&#39;s Melt-in-Your Mouth Custard Pudding&#34;."
