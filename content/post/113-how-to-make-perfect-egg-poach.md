Crack each large egg into a separate small bowl (do not use eggs with broken yolks). When a few bubbles have broken the surface of the water, gently pour each egg into the pan, leaving room between them. One egg of the two survived but the yolk was solid, some of the white was rubbery and the rest of the white was still liquid. The kids didn&#39;t get poached eggs for breakfast but they did get an egg-cellent tutorial on how to clean a microwave. Fresh eggs (particularly farm fresh) are best for poaching and will hold their shape well.
