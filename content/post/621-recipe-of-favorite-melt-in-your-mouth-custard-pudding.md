recipeingredient:
- " Caramel"
- "190 grams Granulated sugar"
- "60 ml Boiling water"
- " Custard"
- "400 ml Double cream"
- "400 ml Milk"
- "6 Egg yolks large"
- "95 grams Granulated sugar"
- "1 dash Vanilla essence"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the granulated sugar in a small saucepan and dissolve over medium heat. After completely dissolving, it will start to brown and bubble. When it bubbles a lot, remove from heat."
- "Place the pan in a bowl filled with cold water for 2 seconds and remove the pan from the water immediately."
- "Add 60 ml of water little by little and stir well with a wooden spatula. While doing this the caramel boils fiercely and releases a lot of steam so be careful."
- "After adding all the water the caramel settles like this."
- "While it is hot pour the caramel into the glass jars and chill them in the fridge to set. If you pour the custard pudding mixture before the caramel sets, the pudding will get mixed with the sauce. So set the caramel first."
- "Put the double cream and milk in a sauce pan and heat to 50℃. Do not overheat. Turn off the heat when the temperature has reached 50℃."
- "Put the egg yolks and granulated sugar into a bowl and beat with a hand whisk."
- "Add the Step 6 mixture into the Step 7 eggs little by little and continue to stir constantly. At first add a little mixture at a time because the egg yolks make lumps."
- "After combined, add a few drops of vanilla essence. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve."
- "After straining, remove the little bubbles on the surface with paper towels. This will allow the finished pudding to have a smoother texture."
- "Remove the chilled jars from the fridge. Pour the custard pudding mixture gently into each jar without making bubbles."
- "Boil water in a pan large enough to accommodate all jars. This pan needs a lid too. Fill the pan with water up to 1/2 to 1/3 full."
- "To avoid the hot water from splashing into the inside of the jars cover the jars with aluminum foil."
- "After bringing it to a boil, turn off the heat. Arrange the jars in the pan and cover with a lid. Steam for 13 to 17 minutes over a low heat."
- "After steaming, take one out and uncover it. Shake the jar and if the pudding surface looks runny you need steam it longer."
- "If the surface looks thick and moves gently it is done. Uncover to cool. After cooling, chill in the fridge for 4 hours."
- "This is very soft custard pudding so be careful if you have to them carry around. They are so fragile."
