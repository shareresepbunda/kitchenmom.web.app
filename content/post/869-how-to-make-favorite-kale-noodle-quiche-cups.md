recipeingredient:
- "2 medium eggs"
- "1/2 cup Kale chiffonade"
- "1 small onion finely chopped"
- "4 garlic pods crushed"
- "1 cup noodles boiled"
- "3 tbsp boiled peas"
- "1/4 cup whole milk or thick cream if you are not counting your calories"
- "1 tablespoon olive oil"
- "To taste Salt"
- "As needed Mixed herbsThyme oregano basil"
- "1/4 tsp Chilli flakes optional"
- "Pinch black pepper"
- "1/4 cup grated mozzarella cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 100°F. Wash and chiffonade kale leaves. In a medium skillet, add the olive oil. Add the crushed garlic and chopped onions and sauté until pink. Add the chopped kale, boiled noodles and peas. Cook until soft and done. Add the salt, mixed herbs and I added little chilli flakes as I like my food a little spicy"
- "In a bowl, beat the eggs with the milk, salt, and pepper, add a little boiled and pureed kale if you want it healthier. Instead of baking tray or ramekins, I used silicon muffin cups. There is no need to grease them and the baked quiche just pop out neatly from them. Spoon the kale-noodle mixture first into the muffin. Then pour the egg mixture. Top it again with the kale noodle mix. Add the grated mozzarella cheese on top of each."
- "Put the cups on a baking tray and place in the oven and bake for 15 to 20 mins, or until the tops are glossy green. If you are not very sure then insert a toothpick and check if it comes clean. Once done remove from oven and serve warm with fresh basil and mint sauce."
