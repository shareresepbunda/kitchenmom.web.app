recipeingredient:
- "2 crumpets"
- "7 g salted butter for spreading"
- "Half a small can of mushy peas around 150g"
- " Thin cured and smoked German ham slices around 34"
- "1 medium fresh egg"
- "1 pinch dried mint"
- " Salt and pepper to season"
- " Dried parsley to garnish optional"
- " For poaching the egg"
- "1 good pinch of salt"
- "1 tbsp white wine vinegar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring a small saucepan of salted water to the boil and turn down the heat a notch so the bubbles are gently rolling inside the pan, so it&#39;s not too vigorous. Stir through the white wine vinegar."
- "Gently crack the egg into a small bowl, ensuring the yolk is still intact."
- "Place the crumpets in the toaster and begin to toast them to your preference. In a small saucepan or in the microwave heat the mushy peas until warm. Season with a little salt and pepper. Stir through a good pinch of dried mint."
- "Using an egg timer or clock, as soon as a new minute has just past gently slide the egg from the bowl into the boiling water, make sure this is done so the yolk isn&#39;t split. Time the egg for exactly two minutes. After two minutes, remove the egg using a slotted spoon and inspect it. If the egg white still looks a little translucent place it back for a few seconds. Place on some kitchen roll to remove any excess water."
- "Butter the toasted crumpets and spread half of the mushy peas over each one up to the edges. Next place a couple of slices of ham over each one. Stack them on top of each other."
- "Finally gently place the poached egg on top, season with salt and pepper and garnish with a little sprinkle of dried parsley."

Alas, when you buy a ham, it most often is labeled something else, like Boiled Ham, Canned Ham, Ibérico Ham, Picnic Ham, Prosciutto, Smithfield Ham, Smoked Ham, Spiral Cut Ham, and Virginia Ham to name a few. By far the most popular hams in the US are wet-cured hams, hams that have been injected with a brine and then pre-cooked. After the ham has come up to temperature, place ham directly onto the smoker grate, flat side down. You should not place ham too close to the firebox, as this could cause the sugars on the outside of the ham to burn rather than caramelize. You&#39;ll want to smoke your ham for at least three hours, though you should only go longer at your own peril.
