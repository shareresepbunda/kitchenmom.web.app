recipeinstructions:
- "Add 1 tbsp butter to a small pan on medium heat. Add the shallot, and cook gently for 1 minute. You&#39;re not browning the shallot, just taking some bite out of them."
- "Add the spinach to the pan. It should start to wilt pretty much immediately. Add the cream cheese and nutmeg. Stir until the cheese is melted and coats the spinach."
- "Make a slurry by mixing the cornstarch with 1 tbsp water. Pour it into the pan and stir for about 1 minute until the sauce thickens. Season with salt and pepper, then turn the heat down to its lowest setting to keep the spinach warm."
- "Add a large knob of butter to a small nonstick pan on medium-low heat. Once melted, add the eggs. Season with a pinch of salt and freshly cracked black pepper, then cover with a lid. If you have one, use a glass lid so you can keep an eye on the eggs. Cook until the whites are just set but the yolks still have jiggle. Remove the eggs to a plate."
- "Toast your bread. Assemble by topping the toast with a spoonful of spinach, then the egg. Finish with a sprinkle of freshly grated pecorino romano cheese."
