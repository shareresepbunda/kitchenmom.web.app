recipeinstructions:
- "Line up your Tupperware where you’re chopping, it makes it so much easier!"
- "Start boiling your eggs now so they’re done by the time you’re ready for them. When the water is hot but not boiling place the 6 eggs in the pan with water an about inch above them. Once the water starts to boil start your timer for 7-10 minutes. I like mine at 8 or 9 personally."

The lime juice and Tajin add some tang and a touch of heat again the sweet of the fruit, will wake up your mouth!"
- "Have a bowl full of ice cubes in cold water ready for your eggs and place the eggs in once your timer goes off. Wait 5 minutes and then place 2 eggs per Tupperware with the shell on, you can peel them the morning of...Voila! Easy healthy breakfast! I have this with a cup of English breakfast or Earl Grey and it’s a wonderful start to my day!"
