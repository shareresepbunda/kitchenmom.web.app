recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the poached lemons.  Wash lemons thoroughly.  Slice lemons into 1/8s.  Remove any seeds and excess membrane.  Transfer the lemons into a sauce pot.  Add just enuff water to submerge."
- "Bring it to a boil.  Remove from heat and strain.  Repeat the steps 2 more times.  *Don&#39;t throw out the lemon water, you can use it to make cold brew lemon tea. Store the lemon water in a large container and throw in a few tea bags. Leave it chill in the fridge overnight.*"
- "After boiling and straining for the 3rd time, add lemons back into the sauce pot.  Add water and sugar.  Stir to combine well and turn the heat up to low.  Maintain the temperature at 90 degree celsius or 195 fahrenheit.  Cook for at least 5 hrs or until the lemons are soft and the syrup has caramelized."
- "Keep an eye on it every 15 mins and give it a stir to prevent burning.*  After 5 hrs, remove from heat and pass the mixture thru a sieve over a bowl.  Transfer the lemon residue into a bowl.  Return the leftover syrup into the sauce pot.  Add a bit of water to loosen it up."
- "Turn the heat to medium and cook until it reaches the temperature of 100 degree celsius or 210 fahrenheit.  Pour this syrup over the poached lemons.  Set aside in the fridge until ready to use.  *You can also use this as a spread on toasts.*"
- "Prepare the cake.   Preheat oven to 190 degrees celsius or 375 fahrenheit.   Lightly grease loaf pan with some neutral oil.   Line the bottom with parchment paper.   Grease the parchment paper with oil as well."
- "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peak forms with a hand or stand mixer.   While still whisking, gradually add in the sugar.   Keep whisking until stiff peak forms. It should be glossy and almost double in volume.   Whisk in egg yolks, 1 by 1 until fully incorporated."
- "Fold in the 2 types of flour, 1/3 portion at a time until fully incorporated.   Transfer the batter into the prepared loaf pan.  Wack into the oven and bake for about 20 mins or until it passes the skewer test.   Remove from oven and immediately unmold onto wire cooling rack lined with parchment paper.  Set aside to cool completely."
- "Prepare the lemon syrup.   In a sauce pot, add water and sugar.  Stir to combine well.   Using a potato peeler, peel the skin of the lemon.  *Try your best not to peel the white membrane as well.*"
- "Finely chop the lemon peel into fine pieces and add into the water mixture.  Squeeze in the lemon juice.  Bring the heat up to medium.  Stir to combine well and until the sugar has dissolved.  Bring it up to a simmer."
- "Remove from heat and add in the limoncello.  Give it a final stir.  Keep chill in the fridge until ready to use."
- "Prepare the mascarpone fillings.   Prepare a double boiler.  Add the egg yolks onto the double boiler.  Whisk until it turns pale yellowish.  *Make sure the simmering water does not touch the bowl, else the eggs will scramble.*"
- "Remove from heat, immediately add in the sugar in 1/3 portions at a time.  Whisk until everything is fully incorporated.  The mixture should thicken.  In another bowl, using a hand or stand mixer, whisk egg whites and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form."
- "Add in mascarpone in 1/3s into the yolk mixture.  Whisk until everything is fully incorporated.  Fold in the egg whites in 1/2 portions.  Fold until everything is well combined."
- "Add in limoncello.  Give it a final fold.  Keep chill in the fridge until ready to use."
- "Assemble the tiramisu.   Slice the cake lengthwise into 1/3s. Do it slowly. No rush.  Wet the loaf pan with some water.  Line with parchment paper.  Spread 1/3 portion of the mascarpone filling into the loaf pan"
- "Stack one of the cake slices on top of the filling.   Generously brush the cake with the lemon syrup.  Spread the poached lemon over the cake.  Add another 1/3 portion of the mascarpone filling on top of the poached lemon.  Next, stack another slice of cake over the top."
- "Brush the cake with the lemon syrup.   Spread the remaining portion of the mascarpone filling over the top.   Stack the remaining slice of cake.   Lastly, brush the cake with lemon syrup.   Set aside chilled in the fridge overnight."
- "To serve.  Carefully and swiftly, flip the cake pan onto a cake stand or a serving plate.  You can smoothen the sides and top with a spatula.   Grate some fresh lemon and orange zest over the top.  Slice and serve."
- "For full detailed recipe video: instagram.com/tv/CJDv95Dldx9/"
- "If you wanna make your own limoncello: Fresh Organic Lemon, 2   Flavorless Vodka, 125ml   Caster Sugar, 125g   Filtered Water, 375ml"
- "Using a potato peeler, peel the skin from the lemons.   *Do not peel off the membrane (white part of the skin) as it will leave a bitter taste.*   In a jar, add in vodka and lemon peels.   Cover and set aside in a cool place for at least 3 days.   After 3 days, your vodka should turn yellowish in color.   Drain the mixture thru a fine strainer lined with cheesecloth into another air-tight jar."
- "In a bowl, add in sugar and filtered water.   Stir to combine well and until the sugar has dissolved.   Drain the sugar mixture thru a fine strainer lined with cheesecloth into the lemon vodka.   Cover and shake to combine well.   Set aside in the fridge until ready to use.   *It probably can be kept in the fridge for a long time.*"
