recipeinstructions:
- "First peel and wash your potatoes, cut them into smaller pieces and either grate them on a mandolin, grater or in food processor on grater blade. If you don&#39;t have any of those you can use a blender on a pulse setting to achieve the same result,but you need to be careful not to over blend them or they end up like mashed potato. Squeeze out the potato with your hands, catch the liquid and set aside"
- "Now squeeze out the Sauerkraut, discard the sauer juices, add the Sauerkraut to the potatoes and mix well. Now squeeze out the potato and Sauerkraut mix, discard the liquid."
- "Now carefully drain away the liquid from the potato water, you should be left with the potato starch, add this back to the potato and Sauerkraut and mix in well. If there is not at least one full table spoon of dissolved starch, add some bought corn or potato starch."
- "Now grate the onion on a fine setting"
- "Add the onions, salt and pepper two eggs and mix well"

- "With a tablespoon take out a heap full and carefully flattening this into a patty in the heated pan, take care not to burn yourself. Add another patty, cook no mor than two or three at time or it will be difficult to turn them."
- "Drain on kitchen paper and serve either hot or cold.Every time you add two more cakes add a little more of the oil, until all the cakes are made."
- "Here I served them with quark that I drained,seasoned with dill, wild garlic,salt and ground black pepper,two teaspoons per person, which I spread on smoked salmon over a slice of pumpernickel another German delicatessen, I added a few prawns to have a complete meal."
- "By any means use the same recipe just omit the Sauerkraut if you are not in favour of this, I just added them together as often they are served side by side. I have marked this as 2 servings, those would be generous servings. So you get away with 4 servings if you use the whole amount of recipe. If you double everything it makes 8 good portions."
