- "Cook again over low heat for 1 minute. Combine well."
- "Remove from heat, add 1 tablespoon of the beaten egg and stir. Gradually add a teaspoon of the egg and stir well after each addition."
- "Gradually drizzle in the remaining egg. The dough should become thick that when lifted, it should hang in a triangular shape until dropping after 3 seconds or so."
- "You don’t have to use all of the egg. FYI, the egg  I use was 54.5 g and I was left with 6 g, which means I used 48.5 g. But this depends on the temperature or humidity. Add as much egg until the dough turns to consistency shown in Step 7."

- "Transfer the tray into the preheated 200℃ oven for 10 minutes. Then turn down to 180℃ for another 10 minutes. Do not open the oven door and watch over so that the shells do not scorch. The dough puffs up at 200°C and then dries out at 180℃."
- "Once the puffs have finished baking, you can open the oven door. They won&#39;t deflate so don&#39;t worry."
- "Let the the puffs cool and then slice in half horizontally.  Fill with whipping cream, custard cream and slices of strawberries. Sprinkle powdered sugar on top with a tea strainer."
