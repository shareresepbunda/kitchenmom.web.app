- "Sift together the dry ingredients. Cream together two sticks of butter and 2 cups sugar. Add the eggs in one at a time and combine. Add in half the dry ingredients. Combine. Add buttermilk. Combine. Add remaining dry ingredients. Combine. Drain syrup from strawberries and rhubarb. Combine and reserve. Add in rhubarb. Combine."
