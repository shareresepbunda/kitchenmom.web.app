recipeingredient:
- "3 eggs hard boiled"
- "1 heaping spoonfull of mayonnaise"
- "1 dash salt and pepper"
- "1 sliced loaf of bread"
recipeinstructions:
- "Hard boil eggs if you don&#39;t have any: Boil enough water to entirely cover eggs, CAREFULLY place eggs in water (with a sifter or something, good eggs sink and will crack if dropped in) and bring down to simmer. 12 minutes later take the eggs out and place into cool water until cool enough to handle. HB eggs last a week."
- "Chop your eggs before you add mayonnaise. Take a yolk out if you are trying to be healthier. Toast the bread while you mix up mayonnaise and chopped egg, add salt/pepper to taste"
- "Spread on toast, eat, and be happy :D. You get about 1 sandwich per egg (I guess it depends of the size of the bread and eggs). Only use 1 piece of bread and use as a spread if you are trying to eat less. DOES NOT LAST LONG so eat there and then. Not a sandwich you send you kid to school with for lunch. Good protein snack."
