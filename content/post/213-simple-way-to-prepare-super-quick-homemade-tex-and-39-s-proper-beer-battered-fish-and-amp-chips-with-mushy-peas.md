recipeinstructions:
- "For best results make your batter an hour before you cook and refrigerate. Mix all the dry ingredients in a jug then pour in your beer slowly, stirring until you get a smooth batter. The batter should be the consistency of single cream, adjust amounts of beer or flour until it is. I like to use British beer for flavour."
- "The custard powder is my secret ingredient. It&#39;s basically cornflour with a little sugar, powdered egg, vanilla flavouring, and powdered egg. It will add a little sweetness to your batter, and a little extra colour"
- "Prep your chips (see recipe in my profile: Tex&#39;s No-Fail Chips), and deep fry for 2 minutes at 130°C"
- "Heat your oil to 180°C/356°F. Dip the fish in the beaten egg then dredge with flour. Dip the fish in the batter, and cook for 5-6 minutes according to the thickness of your fillet. Turn halfway through If after its been cooked the batter looks a bit pale, cook for another minute or so until it&#39;s an orangey-brown colour. Keep in a warm oven until ready to serve"
- "While the fish is cooking, make the mushy peas (see my. profile for recipe &#39;Tex&#39;s Mushy Peas&#39;)  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/447768-texs-mushy-peas-%F0%9F%87%AC%F0%9F%87%A7%F0%9F%8D%B2"
- "Heat your oil to 180°C/355°F. Add your chips, and cook until they float, then a little longer until they start to become golden. They should rattle in the fryer basket when shaken if they&#39;re done"
- "While your chips are cooking, reheat your peas, uncovered, stirring frequently. Season with salt. Add a little hot water or the strained juice from the peas if too dry"
- "Drain the fish &amp; chips on kitchen paper for a few seconds then plate up with the peas and plenty of salt and malt vinegar over everything."
- "Enjoy as is..."
- "Or with gravy (see recipe in my profile &#39;Tex&#39;s English Chippy-Style gravy)"
