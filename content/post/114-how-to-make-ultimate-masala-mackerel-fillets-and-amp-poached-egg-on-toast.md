- "1 tiny pinch garam masala"
- "1 tbsp mango chutney"
- "1 tbsp natural yoghurt"
- " Salt to season"
- " To garnish"
- " Nigella seeds"
- "leaves Fresh coriander"
recipeinstructions:
- "Get some water onto boil ready for the poached egg. I like to crack the egg carefully into a small bowl first, to ensure the yolk is intact. Set the egg aside for now. Heat up your grill to a medium low heat. Lightly toast the slice of bread beforehand in a toaster then take the tinned mackerel in chilli sauce and add a tiny pinch of garam masala to it. Gently mix through the sauce then spoon on top of the toasted bread, but reserve a little of the sauce for later."
- "Begin to poach your egg by using a tsp to make a whirlpool by stirring then carefully plopping the egg into the centre. Begin to time for exactly 2 minutes. Place your mackerel on toast under the hot grill to heat through."
- "Once 2 minutes has passed using a slotted spoon carefully lift the egg out of the water and check to see if the whites are cooked through, if not leave in the water for a few more seconds. Lift out and set aside, I usually leave it on the spoon resting upon a piece of kitchen towel to remove excess water."
- "Plate up the mackerel on toast which should now be nicely heated through, drizzle over the reserved sauce, then carefully place the poached egg on top and season with salt. Dress with mango chutney, natural yoghurt, a scattering of fresh coriander leaves and a few nigella seeds. Eat and enjoy! :)"

##### Steps to make Masala Mackerel Fillets &amp; Poached Egg On Toast:

1. Get some water onto boil ready for the poached egg. I like to crack the egg carefully into a small bowl first, to ensure the yolk is intact. Set the egg aside for now. Heat up your grill to a medium low heat. Lightly toast the slice of bread beforehand in a toaster then take the tinned mackerel in chilli sauce and add a tiny pinch of garam masala to it. Gently mix through the sauce then spoon on top of the toasted bread, but reserve a little of the sauce for later.
1. Begin to poach your egg by using a tsp to make a whirlpool by stirring then carefully plopping the egg into the centre. Begin to time for exactly 2 minutes. Place your mackerel on toast under the hot grill to heat through.
1. Once 2 minutes has passed using a slotted spoon carefully lift the egg out of the water and check to see if the whites are cooked through, if not leave in the water for a few more seconds. Lift out and set aside, I usually leave it on the spoon resting upon a piece of kitchen towel to remove excess water.
1. Plate up the mackerel on toast which should now be nicely heated through, drizzle over the reserved sauce, then carefully place the poached egg on top and season with salt. Dress with mango chutney, natural yoghurt, a scattering of fresh coriander leaves and a few nigella seeds. Eat and enjoy! :)


Fill the masala in the slits as much as possible. Take a pan and heat the coconut oil in it. Once it is hot, gently place the fish in the pan. Then add a few sprigs of curry leaves and ginger julienne. In a mixing bowl mix all the masala, salt, turmeric and kokam peels.
