recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 400°F. Divide sausage meat into four equal portions, roll into balls, and chill in the refrigerator until ready to use."
- "Bring a medium saucepan of salted water to boil over high heat. When the water is boiling lower the eggs into the boiling water with a slotted spoon. Boil the eggs for 4 to 6 minutes (4 minutes for runny yolks, 6 minutes for creamy yolks). Meanwhile, fill a medium bowl with ice, cold water, and salt. When the eggs are done boiling, transfer to the ice water bath and let cool. Once cool, dry the eggs and carefully peel."
- "Next, get all your bowls prepped for easy assembly! Place flour in a shallow bowl. Place beaten egg in a second shallow bowl. Combine the breadcrumbs and black pepper in a third shallow bowl."
- "Gently roll the peeled eggs in flour to coat."
- "Rub a thin layer of oil on your hands. Press a sausage ball into your hands to flatten to a thickness of about ⅓ inch. Repeat to form 4 sausage patties. Place a floured egg in the middle of each patty and wrap the patty around the egg. Smooth the surface of the sausage so to form an even coating."
- "Gently dip each sausage-coated egg into into the beaten egg, fully coating. Next, coat each egg in the breadcrumb mixture to cover completely. Place scotch eggs on a parchment-lined baking sheet."
- "Bake eggs in the middle rack of the oven until breadcrumbs are golden brown and sausage is firm and fully cooked (the internal temperature should be 160°F), about 20-30 minutes. Rotate eggs if they appear to be browning unevenly. Serve hot or room temperature. Enjoy!"
