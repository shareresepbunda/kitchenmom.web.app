- "Once they start to bubble slightly, you can flip them over. Once they go a bit brown on both sides, transfer to a plate. Now add some more butter to the pan, and repeat until they&#39;re all finished. You might have to turn the heat down as you cook more to avoid cooking them too fast."
- "If you make all of the pancakes slightly different sizes, then you can stack them like a pyramid on your plate, so the maple syrup will fall off the edges like it&#39;s going down a staircase. Enjoy! ☺️"
