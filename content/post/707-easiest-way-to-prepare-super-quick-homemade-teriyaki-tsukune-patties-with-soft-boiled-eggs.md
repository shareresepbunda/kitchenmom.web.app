There are a lot of traditional vegetables and seafoods - Ground chicken is the main ingredient for Tsukune. Because of the soft texture, it is a popular item for children. Raw ground chicken is much softer than ground beef. Usually, tsukune recipes require eggs or panko to bind the ground meat together so that the meat won&#39;t easily fall apart. However, I learned this trick from my mom to knead the chicken mixture until it becomes pale and sticky.
