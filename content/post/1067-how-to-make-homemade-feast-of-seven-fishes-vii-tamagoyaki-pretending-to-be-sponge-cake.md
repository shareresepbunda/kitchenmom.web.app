recipeinstructions:
- "You can the Japanese mountain yam at a Japanese grocery. The other special tool you will need is a Japanese mortar and pestle aka Katakuchi Suribachi &amp; Surikogi. Please try to get your hands on it as a food processor might not do the trick. I will definitely be using Katakuchi Suribachi &amp; Surikogi to create more recipes in the future. In the meantime, please give this recipe a try. And here I wish you lovely fine people a very Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year!"
- "After shrimps have been shelled &amp; deveined, transfer into a large bowl.  Sprinkle in the baking soda.  Toss to coat well.  Add water and ice cubes.  Set aside for 30 mins."
- "Toss and coat well with some sake.  *If you do not have a Japanese mortar &amp; pestle, you can use a food processor. It might have the same results tho. Give it a few pulses and try not to blitz all the way thru&#39;.*  Coarsely chop shrimps into fine pieces."
- "Transfer the shrimps into a Katakuchi Suribachi.  Using a Surikogi, grind the shrimps into a smooth paste. It is okay if there are some small bits left.  *This may take a while and a bit of a workout.*"
- "Add in scallops, a couple at a time, using Surikogi to grind into a homogenous paste.  Peel nagaimo and grate into the mixture.  Mix until well combine. You should have a gooey and smooth paste.  Once everything is incorporated, add salt, pepper and soy sauce.  Give it a quick mix."
- "Add in yolks, a few at a time, using Surikogi to combine well.  In a separate bowl, using a hand or stand mixer, whisk egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks.  While still whisking, gradually add in the icing sugar, 1/3 portions at a time.  Whisk until everything is homogeneous"
- "You should have a fluffy and glossy mixture.  If your Katakuchi Suribachi is big enuff, you can fold in the meringue. If not, I would suggest transfer the mixture into another large bowl.  Fold in the meringue in portions until everything is incorporated well."
- "You should have a very light and fluffy batter.  Transfer the batter into the prepared cake pan.  Using a skewer to poke any large bubbles.  Wack into the oven and bake for 40 to 50 mins."
- "The cake should be browned and puffed but still wobbly.  Remove from heat and set aside to cool down slightly.  The cake will deflate when cooled and looks like a failed sponge cake.  Slice and serve warm with some Shichimi Togarashi. You can also serve with some wasabi and soy sauce."
