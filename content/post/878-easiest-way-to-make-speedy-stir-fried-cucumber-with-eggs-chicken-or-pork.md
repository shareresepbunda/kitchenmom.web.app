This recipe uses ground pork, but you can substitute chicken or turkey, or even vegetarian options like sliced tofu. You can do this the night before or the day of cooking. As the ground meat marinates, I prep the cucumbers. After washing, I partially peel the cucumbers, so that they have alternating peeled and unpeeled vertical stripes. Now add the cucumbers, fry them until coated with the spices, add the water and go on stir-frying for several minutes on a high heat until most of the water has evaporated.
