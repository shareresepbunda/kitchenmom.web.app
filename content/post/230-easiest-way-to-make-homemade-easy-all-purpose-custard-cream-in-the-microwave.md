recipeinstructions:
- "Put the cake flour and sugar in a heatproof bowl and mix. Combine the milk (or soy milk). Add the eggs and mix well."
- "Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and microwave at 500w for 2 minutes 30 seconds. (If using soy milk, see Step 4.) Mix well with a small whisk or 4 chopsticks held together. Microwave for another 2 minutes."
- "Repeat the microwave-mixing steps while observing how thick the custard is. (If the lines made by the whisk disappear as soon as you move it, the cream is still too thin.)"
- "When I made the custard cream with natural soy milk, it thickened quickly. Using 2 medium sized eggs and a 500w microwave, it took just 2 minutes of microwaving x 2 times, 1 minutes x 1 time, 30 seconds x 1 time."
- "Using 2 medium sized eggs and regular milk, after Step 2, it took 1 minute of microwaving x 2 times, 30 seconds x 4 times."
- "Shake in vanilla essence and mix to finish."
- "Keep microwaving and mixing until surface firms up. When mixed, the cream should feel very thick. When you scoop it up with a whisk it should form soft peaks, and the cream should slowly with a plop."
- "Keep in mind that the pastry cream will thicken even more when cooled, so stop cooking just before it reaches the perfect, desired consistency. Keep mixing well to form a cohesive, smooth cream."
- "If you use half the amount of ingredients ＊: Microwave for 2 and a half minutes once, then microwave for 1 minute x 2 times to finish. When you want a little bit of pastry cream to sandwich in bread and so on, half the amount is convenient."
- "This is a failed example: It&#39;s made with milk, and microwaved for 2 minutes x 3 times. It has lots of tiny lumps. You need to heat it carefully and mix it well to avoid this."
- "When using this cream for cakes or tarts, it will drip when you cut the cake or tart if the consistency is too liquid, so I recommend making it on the stiffer side."
