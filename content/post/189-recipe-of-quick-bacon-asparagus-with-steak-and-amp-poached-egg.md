- "Boil water in a nice deep pot, once the water starts boiling lower the heat so that it simmers. Take an egg and put it into a cup."
- "Season your boiling water with salt then take a fork and make a circular motion so that the water in the pot moves in a circle"
- "Take your egg and gently put it into the water as it is moving in a circle (this closes your egg)"
