recipeingredient:
- "4 small pears"
- "4 cups water"
- "2 cups sugar"
- "1 cup honey"
- "1 small lemon halved"
- "3 cinnamon sticks"
- "1 vanilla bean"
- "1 large egg slightly beaten"
- "1 pack pillsbury sweet hawaiian cresent rolls"
recipeinstructions:
- "Core pears from bottom, leaving stems intact. Peel pears; cut 1/4 in. from the bottom of each to level if necessary. (I was unsuccessful in leaving the stems intact, however, they still came out just fine. I also sliced some instead as an alternative for my smaller children)"
- "In a large saucepan, combine the water, sugar, honey, lemon halves, and cinnamon. Split vanilla bean and scrape seeds; add bean and seeds to sugar mixture. Bring to a boil. (I used a teaspoon or two of vanilla instead as i didnt have a vanilla bean available.)"
- "Reduce heat; place pears on their sides in saucepan and poach, uncovered, until almost tender, basting occasionally with poaching liquid, 16-20 minutes. Remove pears with a slotted spoon; cool slightly. Strain and reserve 1-1/2 cups poaching liquid; set aside."
- "Unfold puff pastry on a lightly floured surface. Cut into 1/2-in.-wide strips. (I used the cresent rolls how they were and didnt cut them) Brush lightly with beaten egg. Starting at the bottom of a pear, wrap a pastry strip around pear, adding additional strips until pear is completely wrapped in pastry. Repeat with remaining pears and puff pastry"
- "Transfer to a parchment paper-lined 15x10x1-in. baking pan. (I also added cinnamon and sugar to the tops before baking.) Bake on a lower oven rack at 400° until golden brown, 25-30 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, bring reserved poaching liquid to a boil; cook until liquid is thick and syrupy, about 10 minutes. Place pears on dessert plates and drizzle with syrup. Serve warm."
- "This was big hit for breakfast and even brunch the next day! It also came out beautiful even though it was not identical! Teeheehee!"
- "The rings did not wrap well. Maybe i shouldve cut those into strips! However, they turned out nicely as planned for the little ones! We also had a whole jar of homemade &#34;Honey Pear Syrup&#34; to store and use for later! Yum!"
