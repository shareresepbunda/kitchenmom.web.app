- "350 grams Kabocha squash peeled"
- "100 grams Sugar"
- "2 Whole egg"
- "2 Egg yolk"
- "160 ml  Heavy cream real cream"
- "160 ml Milk"
- "8 drops Vanilla extract"
- " Caramel"
- "50 grams Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Water"
- "2 tbsp Boiling water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Caramel Sauce: Put the sugar and water in a small pan and set to medium heat. Shake the pan now and again and simmer until the colour darkens."
- "When it becomes this colour, tilt the pan away from you and add the boiling water. Turn off the heat and be careful not to burn yourself!"
- "Whilst still hot, pour the caramel sauce into the cocottes and leave to chill in the fridge."
- "Peel the kabocha squash and cut into bitesize pieces. Heat in a microwave at 600W for 5 minutes."
- "When softened, put into a food processor and blend into a smooth paste. Creating a slightly dry paste with the pumpkins is ideal here."
- "Add the ingredients marked with ● in the order that they are shown on the ingredients list. Hold the whisk vertically and gently whisk the ingredients together."
- "Strain the mixture twice. It might take a bit of effort but this is a really important step."
- "Check that the caramel has hardened (if not your caramel will mix in with the custard pudding mixture) and if it has, pour the mixture into the cocottes."
- "Lightly cover the cocottes with aluminum foil and place them on a baking tray. Fill the baking tray 1 cm deep with lukewarm water and cook the custard puddings in the water bath in an oven preheated to 170°C for 35 - 40 minutes."
- "They will rise and come out fluffy. When they are finished cooking, a toothpick inserted into the pudding will come out clean. When you chill them they should sink down a little."
- "The end result I decorated this one with a glazed kabocha squash peel. I boiled the peel with just enough water to cover it, 1 tablespoon of butter and 2 teaspoons of sugar."
- "If you cover the cocottes with aluminium foil the top won&#39;t brown so much, so make sure to adjust the bake time according to your oven and check that they are cooked through properly."
- "By the way, my oven cooks things quite quickly."
