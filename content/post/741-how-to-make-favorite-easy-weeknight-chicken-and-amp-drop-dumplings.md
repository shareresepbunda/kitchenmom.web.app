recipeingredient:
- " For the Soup Base"
- "1.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast"
- "6 cups low sodium chicken broth"
- "1 tsp all purpose poultry seasoning"
- "3 tbs unsalted butter"
- "1 small yellow onion  chopped"
- "1/2 cup sliced baby carrots or 12 diced reg carrots"
- "1/4 cup all purpose flour"
- "1 cup water"
- " For the dumplings"
- "1 cup all purpose flour"
- "1 tbs dried parsley"
- "1/2 tbs baking powder"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1 tbs unsalted butter"
- "1 large egg"
- "1/3-1/2 cup milk start with less add more if needed"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place chicken, poultry seasoning, and broth in a 4 quart stock pot. Cover. Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Reduce heat to medium low and simmer until chicken is cooked through. About 15-20 minutes (mine took 15)."
- "While chicken is simmering prep your veggies. When chicken is done remove breasts to a plate. Pour broth into a large bowl. Set both aside."
- "Return pot to medium heat. Add butter. When melted add onion and carrots. Cook until onion begins to turn translucent, stirring often. About 2 minutes. Add flour and cook 2 minutes more, stirring frequently."
- "Return broth to pot along with 1 cup water, stirring with a wisk as you add to prevent clumping. Bring soup to a simmer. Cover and cook until carrots are just becoming tender, stirring occasionally. About 8 minutes. While soup is simmering shred the chicken and make the dumplings."
- "To make the dumplings: in a medium bowl stir together flour, parsley, baking powder, and salt. Cut in butter with a fork, knife, or even clean fingers. Stir in egg and 1/3 cup milk just until dough comes together in a tacky ball (if dough seems dry add more milk 1 tbs at a time until it comes together, if too wet add more flour in same fashion)."
- "Stir shredded chicken into broth. Use 2 spoons to drop roughly tablespoon sized dumplings onto top of soup. Be careful not to overcrowd dumplings, and do not stir into broth, let them fall in and float back to the top on their own (you should get about 12)."
- "Cover and poach dumplings in simmering soup until firm. About 8-10 minutes. Dish out 2-3 dumplings with soup per serving. Enjoy!"
