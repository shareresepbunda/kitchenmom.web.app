The saturated fat in butter, cheese, bacon, sausage, muffins, or scones, for example, raises your blood cholesterol much more than the cholesterol in your egg.

Egg &#34;Muffins&#34; is one of the most popular of current trending foods in the world. It's simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It's enjoyed by millions every day. Egg &#34;Muffins&#34; is something that I have loved my entire life. They're fine and they look fantastic.


To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook egg &#34;muffins&#34; using 5 ingredients and 4 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### Steps to make Egg &#34;Muffins&#34;:

1. Spray mini muffin pan with non-stick spray. Preheat oven to 350.
1. Using large spoon or small rubber spatula scoop stuffing into bottom of each muffin cup, pressing down to form the bottom of each &#34;muffin&#34;.
1. Divide eggs into each muffin cup and top with ham (or other protein) and shredded cheese.
1. Bake 6-8 minutes or til cheese is melted and eggs have fully cooked. Tops should be a bit browned. Top with scallions if desired. Serve warm.


Best in cakes, cupcakes, quick breads, muffins, pancakes, and waffles. Use in recipes that call for just one egg, otherwise the recipe could end up being greasy. While you can often sub eggs in a savory recipe with another protein (like adding eggs to a curry or pilaf), this list is aimed at recipes that need their eggs for lift (think fluffy meringue, souffl√©, or waffles), binding (think burgers or patties), or moisture (muffins or loaf cakes). A mashed banana will impart its own flavor and sweetness to any baking recipe. A breakfast burrito on a plate with glass ramekins of salsa and sour cream.
