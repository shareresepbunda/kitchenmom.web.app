recipeinstructions:
- "Make the pastry and crumble early in the day - follow these steps  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/341655-pastry-and-other-things"
- "Make the custard by whisking in a bowl the egg yolks, the sugar and a small amount of milk from the half pint until smooth add the vanilla beans and stir in."
- "Heat the rest of the milk in a pan until it just reaches boiling point. Remove from the heat and add to the bowl whisking as you add."
- "In a cup mix the cream and the cornstarch, add this to the custard. Give it a good whisk and transfer all of it back to the pan."
- "Bring back up to the boil whisking or stirring all the time. When the custard starts to boil, lower the heat and still stirring simmer for 1-2 minutes until sufficiently thickened."
- "Things can go wrong making your own custard, especially the first time. Here are some fixes: firstly - remove custard from heat before doing anything - What happens if my custard goes lumpy? You weren&#39;t stirring efficiently, get out your whisk and beat like there&#39;s no tomorrow!  What if my custard is too thick? Add a little more milk - don&#39;t forget this is going inside a pudding so it needs to be fairly thick.  What if my custard is too thin? Add another tablespoon of cornflour/starch to a tablespoon of cream mix together thoroughly then combine with the custard. What can I do if my custard has burnt on the bottom? Throw it away and soak the pan! Start again."
- "Once custard is made leave to cool this can be made early in the day or even the day before. Place cling wrap into the pan directly on top of the custard ensuring it touches all over, this will stop a skin forming. Cool thoroughly before putting in the refrigerator"
- "I pick lots of apple&#39;s and blackberries and freeze them for jams, tarts, pies and puddings then I take it what I need. Yes I cut and freeze the apples intact with pips and all, because if I decide to make cider I need all those bits! Everything was washed thoroughly before freezing though. It did however make peeling and coring a bit of a chore."
- "You can use freshly picked fruits about ½ pint of blackberries and and 1½ pints of apples, eating or cooking doesn&#39;t matter which, just adjust the sugar. Place fruits in a pan and sprinkle with sugar. Cover pan and leave several hours for juices to come out"
- "When it&#39;s time to make your pudding, turn a low heat under the fruit and slowly bring to a simmer and simmer for 5 minutes. Whilst fruit is simmering, prepare the bowl by greasing well and cutting a small rectangle of greaseproof paper to fit in the bottom."
- "Roll out pastry to fit with a small overhang. Add the fruit mixture. Spoon over the custard and sprinkle over the crumble topping to finish. Bake in an oven set at 180ºC for 30 minutes"
- "Remove from oven, trim any browned overhang and serve warm with cream or ice cream."
- "leave it for at least half an hour before digging in so it doesn&#39;t all fall apart and you don&#39;t burn your mouth!"
