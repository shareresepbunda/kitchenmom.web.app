This creamy spinach polenta is such a dreamy side dish. Packed with Parmesan cheese and earthy spinach, it screams comfort food and makes the perfect side dish for slow roasted meats, veggies, and beans. Personally I love serving it with this Slow Cooker Beef Ragu, Italian Red Pepper Chicken, and Pork Paprikash. It&#39;s a basic Parmesan white sauce fragrant with garlic, onions, and, of course, a whole bag of sautéed baby spinach.

Personally I love serving it with this Slow Cooker Beef Ragu, Italian Red Pepper Chicken, and Pork Paprikash. It&#39;s a basic Parmesan white sauce fragrant with garlic, onions, and, of course, a whole bag of sautéed baby spinach. Baked in a trusty casserole dish, this polenta Florentine is vegetarian comfort food at its finest. (Image credit: Joe Lingeman) Grab a bag of baby spinach the next time you&#39;re at the store, as that&#39;s the heart of the sauce. Giada De Laurentiis explains how polenta, which is made of cornmeal, is Italy&#39;s version of mashed potatoes. To cook polenta, Giada starts with a pot of boiling water, which she seasons with salt.
