recipeingredient:
- "1 thigh Chicken thigh meat"
- "1/2 Onion"
- "15 cm length Japanese leek"
- "1 piece Ginger"
- "2 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "2 tbsp Mirin"
- "1 tbsp Sake"
- "1 to 2 tablespoons  Honey or sugar if you dont have honey"
- "1 bit less than 1 teaspoon Dashi stock granules"
- "250 ml Water"
- "1 tbsp Vegetable oil"
- "3 large Egg"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces. Slice the onion into 1cm wide slices and the leek into 7 mm wide diagonal slices. Slice the ginger thinly."
- "Heat some oil in a frying pan and stir fry the ginger and chicken, until the chicken is browned on the surface."
- "Add the onion and leek and stir fry until browned. Add the rest of the ingredients and bring to a boil. Skim off any scum."
- "While this simmers, beat the egg lightly. I recommend beating it just enough so that the yolk and white aren&#39;t totally mixed together."
- "When the sauce in the pan has reduced by a bit less than half, swirl in the beaten egg and put a lid on. When the egg is soft-set (or to the doneness you like) it&#39;s done."
- "Serve on top of rice.  It looks nicer if you scoop it on top of the rice carefully with a spatula so that you don&#39;t mess up the soft-set egg."
- "I edited the amount of honey needed, since I think some people like it sweet while others might not. Personally I like to use 2 tablespoons, since I prefer this on the sweet side."
