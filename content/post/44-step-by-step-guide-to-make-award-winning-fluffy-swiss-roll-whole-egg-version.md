recipeinstructions:
- "Line the baking sheet with parchment paper. Bring eggs to room temperature and sift the flour in advance. Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C."
- "Break the eggs in a bowl and add all the sugar. Whisk well until it forms some bubbles."
- "When you stick your finger in the egg and it feels cold, heat it up in a microwave for 10 seconds at a time and bring the egg to be a little warmer than body temperature. Make sure to mix each time you heat it up."
- "When the egg is warm, whisk using the highest level on the hand mixer until the mixture becomes white and thickens. Whisk until you can see a trace when you lift up the hand mixer..."
- "Then reduce the level of the hand mixer to the lowest and mix for about another 2 minutes to make the mixture fine and smooth. Mix until the mixture drips slowly when you lift up the hand mixer."
- "Add the sifted cake flour in 4 to 5 portions and mix with a rubber spatula. Mix from the center towards outside like cutting it."

- "Pour the roll cake batter into the baking sheet from a high angle to eliminate big air pockets."
- "Use something like a card to even out the surface. Tap the bottom of the baking sheet 2 to 3 times to eliminate air pockets. Bake in  350°F/180°C for 12 minutes. After baking for about 6 minutes, turn around the baking sheet and continue baking."
- "Once the sponge cake is baked, take it out of the baking sheet. Cover the surface with cellophane wrap tightly so that the sponge dry won&#39;t become dry, and let it cool."
- "Put all the ingredients for the cream in a bowl and whip up a stiff whipped cream."
- "When the sponge cake has cooled down, scrape off the browned parts using a kitchen knife or a pallet, and then place the cake on a new piece of parchment paper."
- "Spread the cream on the cake. Let the cream on the side close to you to be thicker, and the other side thinner. Then roll up the cake slowly and gently."
- "After rolling, wrap it tightly with cellophane wrap. Chill well in the refrigerator with the rolled end facing down."
- "Cut the cake into the size you like and then it is ready It&#39;s also delicious when you put fruit inside."
- "This is a recipe making the dough by separating the egg into egg yolk and egg white."
