recipeinstructions:
- "Use room temperature eggs."
- "Stir ingredients A under low heat.  Mix well until the granulated sugar melts completely. Once the liquid is warm to the touch (approx. 40-50℃) remove from heat."
- "Cool the liquid from Step 2 until it reaches a temperature of around 30℃. If the liquid is too warm the eggs will cook. If it is too cold it is not good either. Always make sure the temperature is around 30℃."
- "Mix the eggs well without whipping them. Tilt the bowl and cut into the egg whites with a linear hand movement."
- "Pour liquid from Step 3 gradually into the eggs from Step 4 as you continue to whisk.  Once they are combined, mix well."
- "Strain the combined liquid from Step 5 through a fine mesh sieve or a tea strainer at least once. There will be small lumps from the egg whites. Make sure to strain these as it will make a difference in the smoothness of the pudding."
- "I use a tea strainer to strain the liquid from Step 6 into a measuring cup first. Then I am ready to transfer this into a heatproof pudding mold."
- "The small ramekin pictured here has a (6 cm diameter x 5.8 cm height) 55 ml capacity."
- "I strain the liquid from Step 7 into the ramekin using a tea strainer."
- "Place an aluminum lid over the ramekins. If your ramekins come with lids, use them instead of the foil."
- "Pour hot water in the baking pan and place the ramekins and steam bake in a 160℃ preheated oven for 20 minutes. Then lower the temperature down to 140℃ and continue for another 27 minutes."
- "Baking times will differ according to the ramekin size and individual ovens. For the mini ramekin pictured in Step 9, I them bake at 160℃ for 15 minutes then 130℃ for 15 minutes."
- "I explained how to steam bake these using an oven but if you wish to use a pot over a stovetop, refer to."
- "If the skin forms on the top and the center of the pudding jiggles when gently shaken, it is done."
- "This is how a freshly made pudding will look. It is barely solid."
- "Our electric oven is rather weak in power.  Try steam baking at 140℃ for 15 minutes first and then check for doneness. If it looks like Step 15-16, it should be fine."
- "If you need to continue steam baking add more hot water onto the baking pan and monitor every 5 minutes. Use hot water when you steam bake initially."
- "Over cooking will ruin the texture of the pudding. Freshly baked pudding may be loose but when cooled it will solidify."
- "Cool the pudding down to room temperature then wrap firmly and cool in the refrigerator."
- "While waiting for the pudding to cool down, make the caramel sauce following steps fromand cool it in the refrigerator.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/145037-golden-caramel-sauce"
