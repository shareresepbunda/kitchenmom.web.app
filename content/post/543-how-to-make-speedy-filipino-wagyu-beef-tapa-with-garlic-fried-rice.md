recipeinstructions:
- "PREPARING THE MARINADE  Mix together the soy sauce, lemon juice, minced garlic, brown sugar, kosher salt, and baking soda in a small bowl.  Cut your Wagyu chuck steak into thin slices against the grain.  Place the steak in a Ziploc bag, and pour soy mixture over the beef. Massage the mixture into the beef.  Seal the bag, and place it in the refrigerator for 12-24 hours."
- "PREPARING THE RICE  Cook your jasmine rice in a pot with water.  Once the rice is cooked (all of the water has been absorbed), place the rice in a bowl. Make sure the bowl is covered.  Place the bowl of rice in the refrigerator, and allow the rice to cool."
- "PREPARING THE SLICED GARLIC  Pull the bag of marinated Wagyu beef from the refrigerator, and place it at room temperature.  Heat a wok over medium-high heat, and add in 2 tablespoons grapeseed oil.  Once the oil is hot, add in the sliced garlic, and begin to brown.  Stir and flip the garlic making sure it does not burn.  Once the sliced garlic is browned, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the pan. Set it aside, and reserve."
- "PREPARING THE FRIED RICE  Heat the wok up over high heat, and add in 1 tablespoon of grapeseed oil (you will still have some garlic oil in the wok).  Add in the minced garlic, and cook until it is starting to brown.  Then, add in the cooked and cooled jasmine rice.  Use a wooden spoon to break up any pieces of clumped rice.  Stir fry the rice until it is starting to brown and warmed through.  Place the rice on a back burner to keep it warm.  Season to taste with kosher salt."
- "PREPARING THE WAGYU BEEF  Heat a large saute pan over medium-high heat with 2 tablespoons of grapeseed oil.  Once the oil is hot, add in the marinated Wagyu steak slices in a single layer.  Let the steak slices sear on one side for 2 minutes.  Then, flip the beef to sear the other side.  Cook over medium-high heat until there is no liquid left in the pan, and the beef is cooked through (approximately 2-3 more minutes)."
- "FINAL STEPS  Prepare your over easy eggs, cooking two of them at a time (so you’ll have 3 sets of over easy eggs).  Divide the garlic fried rice between bowls.  Top each bowl with slices of Wagyu steak.  Add one set of over easy eggs to each bowl, as well as some diced tomato, cucumber slices, and browned garlic slices.  Serve, and enjoy!"
