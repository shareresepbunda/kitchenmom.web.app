recipeingredient:
- "2 eggs"
- "1 pinch white pepper"
- "1 qt chicken broth"
- "to taste salt"
- "2 inches ginger peeled"
- "2 scallions for garnish"
- " Optional monosodium glutamate"
- "4 tbsp cornstarch  8tbsp water slurry"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice ginger into half-centimeter slices, and thinly slice the white part of the scallions to use for garnish."
- "In a pot, add broth, ginger, and green upper halves of the scallions. Bring to a boil for a few minutes or until you can taste lightly the ginger in the broth, then remove the ginger and scallions."
- "In the meantime, whisk together eggs and white pepper and set aside."
- "Salt the broth to taste (over-salt slightly to accommodate for the slurry), then add the slurry. The soup should be thickened quite considerably, but not gloppy."
- "Bring the broth back to a slight rolling boil, such that the broth at the outer rim of the pot is bubbling towards the center. This is crucial; you will be pouring your egg mixture over this small current to create the distinct ribbons."
- "When slowly pouring your egg mixture, flick a pair of chopsticks back-and-forth underneath the stream of eggs, to create smaller streams of egg mixture before it lands on the &#34;bubbling edge&#34; of the pot. Allow the bubbling edge/current to push the eggs towards the center of the pot, and create more space before you continue pouring. If the surface of your pot is getting full, gently push eggs towards the center. Repeat until you&#39;ve poured all of the egg."
- "Let any remaining egg mixture cook for a few seconds, then gently swirl the soup. Add any additional salt or seasonings to taste, then serve with sliced scallions."
