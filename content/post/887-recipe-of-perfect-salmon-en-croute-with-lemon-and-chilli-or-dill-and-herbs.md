- "Egg wash around the salmon and then Place the 2nd piece of Pastry on top and push the pastry edges together. Using a fish slice carefully transfer to the Baking Sheet and tuck in the pastry all the way around. Then crimp the edges together - I just use 3 fingers and push firmly around the edge. Brush the whole thing with egg and put into fridge for at least 45 mins or even the day before needed."
