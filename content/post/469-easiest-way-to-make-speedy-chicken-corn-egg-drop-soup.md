recipeingredient:
- "4 ounces chicken breast finely chopped"
- "1 tablespoon water"
- "1 teaspoon cornstarch"
- "1 teaspoon oyster sauce"
- "1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen sweet corn"
- "5 cups organic or homemade chicken stock"
- "1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder"
- "1/2 teaspoon sesame oil"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste"
- "1 pinch white pepper"
- " Cornstarch slurry  cup cornstarch combined with  cup chicken stock"
- "2 egg whites lightly beaten you can also include the yolks if you want"
- "1 scallion chopped"
- "1 tablespoon chopped cilantro optional"
- " Freshly ground black pepper optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Marinate the chicken with 1 tablespoon of water, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, and 1 teaspoon oyster sauce. Mix until the liquid is absorbed into the chicken. Set aside."
- "Finely mince ½ cup of the corn kernels and set aside. Add the chicken stock, minced and whole corn kernels, and turmeric powder to a pot and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes."
- "Next, add the sesame oil, salt, and white pepper. Turn up the heat slightly. Add the chicken to the soup, and use a spoon to break up any clumps of chicken while stirring for one minute."
- "Re-mix the cornstarch and chicken stock slurry until incorporated (since the cornstarch and water will separate when left to sit for more than a few minutes). Use a spoon or a whisk to stir the soup while slowly pouring in the cornstarch slurry. The soup will begin to thicken further as the cornstarch cooks. Keep stirring for another 30 seconds. If the soup is too thick, add more stock, and if it’s too thin, add more cornstarch slurry until the soup is at your preferred consistency."
- "Next, use a large spoon or ladle to gently stir the soup in one direction, while slowly pouring the beaten egg whites into the soup. Stirring slowly in a large slow circular motion will yield large “ribbons” of egg and stirring faster will result in a finer “egg flower.” Again, use your own discretion on how you personally like the texture of the egg!"
- "Stir in half of the scallions, and add the rest as a garnish for serving. If you’re looking for a bit more flavor, you can also drizzle a bit of sesame oil over the top and sprinkle some chopped cilantro and fresh ground black pepper over each bowl."
