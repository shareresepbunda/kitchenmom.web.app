With a spoon, begin stirring the boiling water in a large, circular motion. When the water is swirling like a tornado, add the eggs.

Dropping an egg into really hot oil is going to cause all the water in the egg to turn to steam very quickly, hence the nuclear mutant effect you no doubt got. If you want to poach in oil then you need to keep the temperature way down.
