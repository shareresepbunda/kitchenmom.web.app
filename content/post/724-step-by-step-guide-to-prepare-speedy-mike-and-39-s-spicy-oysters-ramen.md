recipeinstructions:
- "Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll need. The options are to the right side of photo."
- "Gather all of your fresh vegetables and chop those vegetables that need to be. If you&#39;re opting for the ingredients in the Options section - add them at the same time as the rest of your ingredients. Except for your fresh oysters. Add them just before you add your noodles."
- "Boil Ramen Noodles for 2 1/2 minutes. Drain. Evenly coat noodles lightly with Wok Oil and mix well to keep them from drying out. Place in a sealed container until you&#39;re ready for them.                                                                                               ● Tip: When draining your noodles in the sink - drain your water slowly. Otherwise, if you just dump quickly - the boiled water will seize up in the drain and force water back up from drain and hit your noodles. Yuck!"
- "Heat your Wok and add Wok Oil. Add your Red Pepper Flakes."
- "Add your vegetables to your high heated Wok and cook on high for 2 minutes. Also, add Oyster Sauce and Siracha. Stir regularly. You don&#39;t want to burn your garlic!"
- "Add your Ramen Noodles to your Wok and mix quickly until noodles are completely coated."
- "Serve immediately with sides of Siracha and Soy Sauce. Feel free to garnish this dish as you wish. Cilantro, Parsley, Jalapeños, boiled eggs and a wedges of lime all go great with this dish. Enjoy!"
