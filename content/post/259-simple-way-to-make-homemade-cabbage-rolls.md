recipeinstructions:

- "Add the garlic, tomato paste, Italian seasoning and paprika. Continue frying another 2 minutes."
- "Add the Roma tomatoes and cook until they soften, about 2 minutes. Add the passata, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, a good pinch of salt and several grinds of black pepper. Turn the heat down to low and let simmer for 15 minutes. Add additional seasoning as needed. Set the sauce aside until assembly."
- "Rinse the cabbage and put it in a large pot. Fill the pot with enough cold water so that the cabbage will be submerged without the water spilling over once it boils. Remove the cabbage and put the pot on high heat. Once the water boils, turn the heat down to medium-high to keep it simmering."

- "In a large bowl, mix all the filling ingredients by hand until well combined."
- "Preheat your oven to 375 F. Line a baking dish (I used a 9 x 13 in dish) with foil and spread a couple of ladlefuls sauce on the bottom."
- "Place about 2 heap tbsp filling on one half of a cabbage leaf. Tuck the sides in and roll the leaf up into a tight little log around the meat. Put the roll in the tray and repeat until all the leaves and meat are used. Spread the remaining sauce over the rolls. Cover the tray tightly with foil and bake for 1 hour. Serve immediately."
