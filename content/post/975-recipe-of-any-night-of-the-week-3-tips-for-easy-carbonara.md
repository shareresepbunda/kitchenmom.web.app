recipeinstructions:
- "Preparation: Mix all the ● ingredients together! Tear the sliced cheese into small pieces, and chop the bacon and onion! Get the butter ready, too."
- "Bring the water to a boil while you&#39;re preparing the ingredients. Add 1 tablespoon salt here!"
- "Tip No.1: Put the pasta in like this and cook it over medium heat! This way, the pasta won&#39;t get scorched!"
- "After all the pasta is submerged, simmer it gently. Cook it as directed on the package!"
- "Pasta basic: Cook the garlic in pure olive oil over low to medium heat, just until fragrant! It will deepen the flavor."
- "Add the onion and bacon and continue cooking over low to medium heat!  Cook it until the onion is wilted."
- "Tip No.2: Add the butter (or margarine)! This is very important, since it gives the sauce richness without adding heavy cream!"
- "Sprinkle with salt &amp; pepper to finish and turn off the heat! Cover the pan with a lid to keep it warm until the pasta is cooked."
- "Dump the cooked pasta into the frying pan! No need to cool it down!"
- "Tip No. 3: Use the residual heat from the pasta to finish cooking the sauce! Speed is the essence, so mix it in quickly before the pasta gets cold!"
- "Emulsification: If the sauce doesn&#39;t thicken with just the residual heat of the pasta, cook it for a short time on a stovetop over low heat, but do this carefully!"
- "Serving: Serve hot and enjoy!"
- "You can make this with udon noodles, too! Here is the udon version! The sauce is slightly different."
