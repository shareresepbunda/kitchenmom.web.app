recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 325-350°. I used a glass dish so I kept my oven at 325. Depends on what you use to bake"
- "Add oil to skillet to fry up potatoes. You may season these. I used salt, pepper, garlic powder. Stir &amp; cook until fork goes thru potatoes without much effort."
- "Now you can add onion &amp; sausage patties, or preferred meat. Or omit meat all together . This is versatile. Once sausage begins to brown, remove &amp; cut up. Then add back to skillet."
- "Once that has cooked a few minutes, the mushrooms can be added. Once softened, you can turn off heat"

- "Next pour the eggs on top of the potato mixture. The eggs will coat &amp; run to the bottom of the dish. Top with remaining cheese. I used a Mexican blend, shredded plus some Monterey cheese cut up. Any cheese is going to be delicious!"
- "Bake uncovered 20-25 min. My dish was not deep so if yours is, the time may need to be increased. Insert a knife to check the eggs, as the other ingredients have already been cooked. Once done, let cool &amp; enjoy!!"
