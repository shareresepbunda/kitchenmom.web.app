recipeinstructions:
- "In a pot put in 6 eggs. Then, pour in cold water until it covers the eggs about one centimeter above. (This can be water from your sink)"
- "Boil your eggs on high until the water starts to make big bubbles. This is your sign to cut off the heat and transfer your pot to another part of the stove that is not heated."
- "Let your pot sit on the non heated stove for 15 minutes. Make sure to cover with a lid during this process. ( If you don&#39;t have a lid then cover with a pan."
- "After the 15 minutes take your eggs over to your sink and drain the water. Before you do this cover with cold water. Be sure not to drop the eggs! Now cover with cold water again and then drain. This is to get the eggs at a cooler temperature so you can work with them."
- "Lastly take a spoon and tap on the egg. Once it cracks flip the spoon over and help pry the eggshell off. Do this to all of your eggs and enjoy."
- "Once you have finished here are two ways to eat them. Remember this is optional. 1. Make deviled eggs. 2. Sprinkle salt and onion powder over them before eating."
