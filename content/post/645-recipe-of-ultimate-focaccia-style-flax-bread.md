recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350° F. Prepare pan (10 x 15 with sides works best) with oiled parchment paper or a silicone mat."
- "Mix dry ingredients with a whisk."
- "Add wet ingredients to the dry mixture. Stir completely. Make sure there aren&#39;t any obvious strings of egg white left in the batter."
- "Let batter sit 2 - 3 minutes to thicken up. If left too long, it will be difficult to spread."
- "Pour batter onto pan. It will likely mound in the middle, so you&#39;ll get a more even thickness if you spread it away from the center somewhat,  in a rectangular shape. The closer you get to the edge of the pan you get, the thinner your bread will be, so stop an inch or two from the edge."
- "Bake for about 20 minutes, or until it springs back when you touch the top and/or is visibly browning even more than the flax already is."
- "Cool and slice into desired size and shape."
