- "Close the lid of the Instant Pot, seal the Valve. Pressure Cook on HIGH for 3 minutes."
- "Once the pressure cooking cycle is over the Instant Pot will begin to beep. Wait for 10 minutes NATURAL PRESSURE RELEASE and than release the rest of the pressure manually by moving the valve from the sealing to the venting position."
- "Carefully open the lid of the pot and gently fluff the steamed Jasmine Rice with the help of a fork."
- "Immediately transfer the cooked rice into a bowl or a large plate allow it to cool down and than pop it in the fridge to chill it. In the meantime proceed with the rest of the recipe. Chilling the rice will help you make the best ever Hibachi fried Rice and keep the rice grains nice and fluffy."
