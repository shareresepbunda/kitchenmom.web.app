recipeingredient:
- " Pasta of your choice"
- " eggs worth A Egg yolk you could also use 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk"
- " A Parmesan cheese"
- " Garlic finely chopped"
- " or 16 Onion finely chopped optional"
- " Bacon or pancetta is even better cut into 1 cm thick pieces"
- " Extra virgin olive oil"
- " Black pepper preferably coarsely ground"
recipeinstructions:
- "Fill a large pot with 3 liters of water and bring it to boil. This is the water to be used for cooking the pasta. Once the water begins to boil, add 2 tablespoons of salt (this amount is equal to 1% of the weight of the water)."
- "The amount of salt used in Step 1 will also add flavor. Measure out the salt carefully. When the pasta water comes to a boil, turn the heat down very low to have it ready."
- "Prepare and cut the garlic, bacon, and onion as noted in the ingredient list."
- "Combine the &#34;A&#34; ingredients and a dash each of salt and pepper in a bowl and mix well. * I use a small amount of salt and pepper since a lot of the salt will come from the bacon."
- "To drain the pasta, place a strainer over the top of another bowl, which should be larger than the bowl in Step 4. Prepare this beforehand in order to quickly use it as a double broiler."
- "Combine the olive oil, garlic, and bacon in an unheated frying pan and heat over low heat. * Thoroughly transfer the fragrance of each of the ingredients to the oil."
- "When the garlic from Step 6 becomes a light beige color, add the onion, salt, and pepper and heat over medium heat."
- "When the onion from Step 7 becomes translucent, remove from heat. Add the pasta to the boiling water from Step 2 and boil over low heat."
- "When the pasta is cooked to al dente, drain the pasta in the strainer from Step 5 and preserve the water in the bowl underneath."
- "Add the cooked pasta to the frying pan in Step 8 and mix well over a low-medium heat."
- "Add one ladle&#39;s worth of pasta water (or, if you&#39;re using a whole egg, add 0.6 ladle&#39;s worth) and the contents of the frying pan to the bowl in Step 4."
- "Place the bowl in Step 11 over the top of the bowl containing the remaining pasta water to create a double broiler. Heat the pasta and sauce using this method and mix well."
- "(Tip) This carbonara only uses egg for the sauce, so the sauce should become hard around the edges of the bowl. Continuously mix quickly, focusing on the edges of the bowl."
- "Once the egg sauce has reached a preferred thickness, transfer the sauce and pasta onto a plate, add plenty of black pepper, and you&#39;re done!"
- "I sliced Parmesan cheese and used it as a topping. Crisp bacon would also be really delicious."
- "Even though only egg is used for the sauce, by using a double broiler and adding a lot of the pasta water will produce a creamy sauce without lumps. If you have any leftover egg yolks, be sure to give this recipe a try!"
- "Here&#39;s a delicious way of making Authentic Carbonara.. Try this too!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/153137-absolutely-foolproof-authentic-carbonara"
- "Also try this version - &#34;Tomato Carbonara With Plenty Of Bacon&#34;. It&#39;s quite addictive.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/154144-tomato-carbonara-with-plenty-of-bacon"
