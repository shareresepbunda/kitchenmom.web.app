recipeinstructions:
- "First, break 2 eggs and pour only the egg white into the mixing bowl."
- "Add your sugar, salt and lemon juice and stir to dissolve the sugar"
- "Heat the mixture by placing the bowl over a boiling pot just to help denature the proteins in the egg and also dissolve the sugar completely. You don’t want this to boil."
- "Bring it down from the heat and allow it to cool a bit."
- "Use your electric beater or hand mixer and mix till you have a thick consistency. This process takes about 5-10 minutes of whipping to turn the egg whites into homemade whipped cream. If you are whisking with hand and without a mixer or electric beater, it is going to take longer."
- "If you don&#39;t want to cook your mix and you like your eggs raw skip steps 3 &amp; 4. I&#39;ve made mine raw and tastes no different."
