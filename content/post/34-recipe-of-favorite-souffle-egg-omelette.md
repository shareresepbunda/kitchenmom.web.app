recipeingredient:
- "3 eggs"
- "1 table spoon sugar"
- "1/2 teaspoon salt"
- " Vegetable oil optional"
- " Syrup or ketchup optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "First separate the eggs and put the whites into a medium sized bowl and the yolks in a tiny bowl"
- "Now put your sugar into the bowl with the eggs whites. (You can add more it just won’t taste very good)"
- "Now after that is done, grab a mixer and mix the egg white sugar mixture until it becomes meringue. You can use a whisk but it will take a long time and your arms will be sore"
- "After you have mixed your egg white mixture, put the salt with the yolks and mix"
- "Now add the yolks to the egg whites and mix just a little bit. Over mixing will cause it to deflate."
- "Turn your stove to a low heat, I would go super low for best results, and coat the pan in butter/veggy oil to cover the pan. I would use a big pan"
- "After the pan heats up add your mixture and spread it out. Put a cover on it then wait about 5-10 minutes depending on how low your stove is. I usually go with about 9 minutes so the inside cooks."
- "After the 5-10 minutes is up, flip the soufflé in half. Mine turned out as a total fail but whatever, just keep cooking until it’s fully cooked"
- "After it looks cooked enough serve it to a plate, pour syrup, ketchup, whatever you would like and enjoy! Link to original video: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hQH5o-IzwJI"
