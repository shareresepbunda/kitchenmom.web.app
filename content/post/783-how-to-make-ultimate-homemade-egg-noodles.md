recipeinstructions:
- "Melt butter in microwave, 10 seconds at a time, stirring between, until melted. You want the butter melted but not hot."
- "Beat eggs, yolk, and milk together. Slowly stir the butter in."
- "Add flour and salt to stand mixer with dough hook, or make a bowl on a clean surface to hand knead the dough."
- "Mix in hand mixer until ball forms. If ball is sticky, add a tablespoon or so more flour and mix again. If kneading by hand, slowly add liquid ingredients and mix with fingers until incorporated, then knead by hand about 5 minutes, until a smooth ball forms."
- "Put ball of dough in a lightly floured bowl, covered with a towel, and let stand approximately 15 minutes to rest."
- "Once rested, remove from bowl and cut into four."
- "Dust a surface to roll out one of the chunks of dough. You can roll it to whatever thickness you would like for your dish. For chicken and noodles I roll them about 1/4&#34; thick."
- "Let rest after rolling for a minute or two, then take a pizza cutter and cut into strips of the length you desire."
- "Now separate the noodles and drape them over the edge of a large bowl, or the back of a chair with a paper towel under them, to dry, or cook shortly. Personally I make them as needed so never dry them out. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or to your liking."
