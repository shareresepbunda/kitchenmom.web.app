- "This is still golden brown in this photo. Continue to heat until the caramel is dark brown. After this you will have to add hot water. Measure the hot water and heat water in a microwave."
- "Remove the pan from the heat when the caramel is dark brown like this. Reduce the caramel until the it is dark brown and starts to smoke a bit! From this point move quickly."
- "Add 1 tablespoon of hot water into the pan (the caramel spits so be careful not burn yourself). Move the pan around and stir the caramel with a spoon to even."
- "After this step pour the caramel into cups. You don&#39;t need fill the bottom of the cups. Just fill about 1/3 to 1/2 of the bottoms. It will harden after a while."

- "Take out the cups from the bain marie and transfer to a shallow dish to cool. After cooled slightly chill in the fridge."
