You can make similar alterations with the oils that you use for cooking. Olive oil is a monounsaturated fat which can help to lower bad cholesterol. Olive oil can also be healthy for your skin since it is a superb source of vitamin E.  Even though you may already consume lots of fruits and veggies, you might want to consider how fresh they are. If you choose organic foods, you can avoid the problem of eating crops that may have been sprayed with toxic pesticides. Searching for a local supplier of fresh produce will give you the choice of consuming foods that still contain most of the nutrients which are typically lost when produce has been kept in storage before it is sold. Thus, it should be quite obvious that it's not difficult to add healthy eating to your life.
