recipeingredient:
- "2 slices bread"
- "1 avocado"
- " Lemon juice"
- "2 egg"
- " Vinegar"
- " Salt"
- " Chilli flakes optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Toast the bread. I usually use a grill rather than a toaster to control the browning."
- "Carefully cut the avocado in half, remove the stone and scoop out the avocado flesh."
- "Add a little lemon juice to the avocado and mash to your desired constancy and set aside. The lemon is important, it stops the avocado from going off quickly."
- "Heat some water. As it comes to a boil, add some vinegar to the the water."
- "Secret technique - gently crack an egg into a sieve and allow the extra egg white to drain off. You&#39;ll notice that there is still an egg yolk and the main egg white. The extra egg white causes the stringing when you usually poach an egg. Once this is removed, you have a nice, smooth, bubble like raw egg ready for poaching."
- "Stir the boiling water to create a vortex and gently add the egg into the water. Boil for 3 minutes for a runny yolk. You can do two at a time, but I stick to 1 so they don’t interfere with one another. You may need to adjust your time to have your yolk to the consistency that you like."
- "Use a slotted spoon to fish out the egg and place on a kitchen towel to absorb any excess water."
- "Spread the avocado on the toast, add the poached egg, salt and pepper to taste and it’s ready to eat. Enjoy!"
- "Side note: My friend kept wanting to add chilli flakes to the avocado smash, but I’m not sure the flavour comes through. Have a go and see for yourself."
