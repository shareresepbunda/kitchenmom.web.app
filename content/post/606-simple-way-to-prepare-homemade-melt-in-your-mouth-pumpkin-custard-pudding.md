recipeingredient:
- " Kabocha squash"
- " Milk"
- " Eggs"
- " Sugar"
- " Rum vanilla essence"
- " Sugar"
- " Water"
- " plus tablespoon Boiling water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the ○ in a small saucepan and start to heat to make caramel sauce."
- "The sugar syrup starts to make bigger bubbles and release caramel aroma."
- "Add one tablespoon of boiling water and loosen the caramel (it will spit so be careful)."
- "Pour the caramel into the pudding cups. (You don&#39;t want to waste the rest of the caramel stuck to the pan. You can make milk tea with the leftover caramel sauce.) Fill the steamer with water and start to heat on the burner."
- "Mash the kabocha squash in a saucepan with a potato masher or a fork. I cook kabocha in a rice cooker (refer to the tips). Or heat in a microwave for 5 to 8 minutes until completely cooked through and tender."
- "Add the milk and sugar into the 5 pan and put on the heat. Stir and continue to heat until the mixture is warm to the touch. Turn off the heat."
- "Crack the eggs into a bowl and add the vanilla essence and rum."
- "Add the beaten eggs into the 6 pan (this is opposite from when you make plain custard pudding). Stir quickly."
- "Strain the 8 custard pudding mixture through a sieve into the bowl. Stir the bits left in a sieve gently with a spoon (not so hard because you want to have a smooth texture for your pudding)."
- "Pour the mixture into the pudding cups."
- "Place the pudding cups onto a steamer with boiling water underneath (it is very hot so be careful)."
- "Place a chopstick between the lid and pan to make a gap. This helps allow the inside of the steamer not too hot and keep the pudding texture smooth. Steam over a high heat for 3 to 4 minutes."
- "Turn off the heat after the pudding surface is set (when you touch the pudding surface with a chopstick you feel a slight bounce it is ready, not ready while the surface is still runny). Cover with a lid completely and leave to stand for 10 minutes to continue to steam with remaining heat. When you put a toothpick in the middle and it stands straight it is done. If not steam for another minute over a low heat and test again. Repeat this until the pudding has set nicely."
- "When a toothpick stands straight or when you tilt the cup slightly the pudding looks thick like this it is ready. You might think it is too runny but it will harden as it has cooled."
- "Cover with a moistened tea towel on top and leave to cool. After cooled cover with cling film and chill in the fridge. Serve when completely chilled."
- "If you use a 15-cm round mould you will have a 4 to 5-cm thick pudding. Fill the baking tray and set the place the mould onto the baking tray. Steam-bake in the oven preheated to 190ºC for 15 to 20 minutes until a skewer inserted comes out clean. The pudding will have a slightly harder texture and remove from the mould after completely chilled."
