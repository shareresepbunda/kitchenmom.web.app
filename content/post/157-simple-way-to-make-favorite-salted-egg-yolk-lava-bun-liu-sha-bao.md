- "Round it into a ball and place onto a piece of parchment paper. Set aside with a cover. Repeat with the rest."
- "Let them sit and ferment for 45 – 60 minutes or until the size is 50% larger."
- "Steam the bun over medium-low heat (or medium heat depending on your type of steamer) for 6-8 minutes. I suggest doing a test with 1 bun to determine the right timing because the filling will explode when overcooked. Also, wrap the steamer lid with a cloth to prevent water droplets on the buns while steaming."
- "Wait 10 minutes after the heat is off before opening the lid. This will prevent the buns from collapsing. Serve warm to get that tasty molten filling."
