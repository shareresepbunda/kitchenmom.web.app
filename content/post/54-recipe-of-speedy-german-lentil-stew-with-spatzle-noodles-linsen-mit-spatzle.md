recipeinstructions:

- "Cube the carrots and potatoes. Dice the onion and bacon."
- "In a large pot, heat a little oil and cook the onions and bacon until onions are translucent."
- "Add carrots, potatoes, lentils and bay leaf to the pot and pour in enough water and/or broth to cover everything. Bring to a boil."
- "Add red wine and reduce heat to a simmer. Cook about 30 minutes or until soft the lentils are soft."
- "Add whole sausages and let cook another 5-10 minutes."
- "Add apple cider vinegar and a little more red wine. Bring to a simmer again and let cook for a few more minutes, or until the stew becomes thick and porridge-like."

- "Method 1: The cutting board method: Put some of the batter on a cutting board and using a knife, cut and scrape small bits of batter into the boiling water."
- "Method 2: Use a wide-holed colander or something similar.  Press the batter though that so it drops into the boiling water."
- "The noodles will get fluffy as the cook and float to the top. When the float to the top, remove with a slotted spoon into a colander/strainer."
- "Immediately dunk the finished noodles into some warm water, which prevents them from sticking together. Drain and divide onto plates."
- "Spoon over the cooked lentils."
- "Serve and add a splash more apple cider vinegar, and salt &amp; pepper if you like. The dish should have a nice hint of vinegar taste."
