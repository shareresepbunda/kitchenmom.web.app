recipeingredient:
- "3 Egg yolk"
- "50 grams Sugar"
- "20 grams Cake flour or cornstarch"
- "3 tbsp Cocoa powder"
- "1 chocolate bar Dark chocolate"
- "500 ml Milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the egg yolks to a saucepan and combine them well with the sifted flour, sugar, and cocoa powder to form a paste."
- "Add the chocolate to a heat-resistant dish and submerge it with some (not all) of the milk. Then wrap the dish with cling film and heat it in the microwave for 1.5-2 minutes."
- "When the chocolate has mostly melted, mix the chocolate into the mixture from Step 1 in stages well so that it doesn&#39;t go lumpy."
- "Then, place the saucepan over medium heat and pour in the rest of the milk. Carefully stir the mixture until it thickens, just as if you were making custard cream."
- "When the mixture is thick enough to leave light trails, pour the mixture into dishes or ramekins, place them in the refrigerator, and leave them to chill. They&#39;re ready."
- "If you like, try adding some amaretto, rum, or other liqueur for a deliciously sophisticated flavour."
- "When you take these puddings out of the fridge, try topping them with raspberry or other berry-based sauces, the flavours go together really well. You could use slightly sweet heavy cream as well."
