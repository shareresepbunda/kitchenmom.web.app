- "Method 2: Use a wide-holed colander or something similar.  Press the batter though that so it drops into the boiling water."
- "The noodles will get fluffy as the cook and float to the top. When the float to the top, remove with a slotted spoon into a colander/strainer."
- "Immediately dunk the finished noodles into some warm water, which prevents them from sticking together. Drain and divide onto plates."
- "Spoon over the cooked lentils."
- "Serve and add a splash more apple cider vinegar, and salt &amp; pepper if you like. The dish should have a nice hint of vinegar taste."
