- "For the syrup:  Simmer the sugar, water, and orange blossom water (or rose water) until the sugar dissolves, about five minutes.  Then, use a fork to poke a few holes on the cake. Pour the syrup over the hot cake. Let sit until completely absorbed."
- "For the chocolate topping:  Melt the chocolate over a double boiler and stir in the oil."
- "Refrigerate until the chocolate sets, then slice into squares."
