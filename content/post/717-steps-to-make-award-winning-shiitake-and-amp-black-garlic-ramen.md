- "2 Tablespoons Sweet Chili Sauce"
- "1 (1 inch) Piece Ginger"
- "1 1/2 Tablespoons Soy Marinade"
- "1 Tablespoon Sesame Oil"
- "1 Teaspoon Kombu"
- "1/2 Ounce Dried Shiitake Mushrooms"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat a medium pot of salted water to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. In a bowl, combine the dried shiitake mushrooms and 3 cups of hot water. Let stand for at least 10 minutes. Remove and discard the stems of the kale; roughly chop the leaves. Peel and finely chop the ginger. Peel and finely chop the garlic. Cut off and discard the root ends of the scallions; thinly slice, separating the white bottoms and green tops."
- "Add the chopped kale to the pot of boiling water. Cook 5 to 7 minutes, or until wilted. Drain thoroughly and set aside in a warm place. Refill the pot with salted water; heat to boiling on high."
- "While the kale cooks, reserving the water, transfer the rehydrated shiitake mushrooms to a cutting board; roughly chop. In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped ginger, chopped garlic, chopped mushrooms, and sliced white bottoms of the scallions; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant."
- "Add the reserved mushroom water, soy marinade, and sweet chili sauce. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium; cook, stirring occasionally, 4 to 6 minutes, or until the liquid is slightly reduced in volume. Turn off the heat; stir in the cooked kale and sesame oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide between 2 bowls. Rinse and wipe out the pan."
- "In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium until hot. Keeping them separate, crack the eggs into the pan; season with salt and pepper. Cook 4 to 5 minutes, or until the whites are set and the yolks are cooked to your desired degree of doneness. Turn off the heat."
- "While the eggs cook, add the noodles to the same pot of boiling water, stirring gently to separate. Cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until tender. Drain thoroughly. Divide the cooked noodles between the bowls of cooked vegetables and broth; stir to combine. Top with the fried eggs. Garnish with the sliced green tops of the scallions and kombu. Enjoy!"
