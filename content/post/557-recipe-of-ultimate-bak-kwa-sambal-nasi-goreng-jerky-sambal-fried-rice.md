recipeinstructions:
- "You can check out my previous post on how to make bak kwa."
- "Wash and drain the rice 3 times. Add water to submerge the rice at about a knuckle depth. Cook the rice in a rice cooker as per the manufacturer&#39;s instructions. Once the rice is cooked, fluff the rice. You should have about 2 to 3 cups of cooked rice. Keep chilled in the fridge overnight."
- "In a bowl, add in kecap manis, ketchup, @chillibellasg’s Sambal, shrimp paste &amp; garlic. Mix until well combined. In a skillet or pan over medium heat, add sesame oil. Once the oil is heated up, add in the onion."
- "Season with salt and sugar. Sauté until lightly caramelized. Add in the rice. Break up any large clumps of rice with a spatula. Sauté until well combined. Add in the sambal mixture and 1/4 cup of hot water."
- "Sauté until well combined, making sure every grain of rice is well coated. Toss in the bak kwa &amp; scallions. Taste and adjust for seasoning with salt &amp; pepper. Lastly, drizzle some sesame oil over the top to really wake up the flavors. Remove from heat &amp; transfer onto serving plates."
- "In the same skillet or pan over medium heat, add in about 1/2 inch of oil. Once the oil reaches the smoking point, slide in an egg. *I prefer cracking my eggs in a cup to prevent any rotten eggs or cracked shells.* Tilt the skillet or pan and baste the egg with all the liquid. Keep basting until the edges are crispy. Repeat the steps for the remaining egg. Serve the fried rice with the fried eggs, cucumber and some more of that @chillibellasg’s Sambal."
- "Pro Tip: You can combine 2 TBSP of soy sauce &amp; molasses to create kecap manis if you can&#39;t find any. If you are not residing in Singapore, you can replace the sambal with any chili or hot sauce of your preference. Harissa, Sambal Oelek or Thai Red Chili Sauce will be awesome as well. If you can&#39;t get your hands on any fermented shrimp paste, you can use Lee Kum Kee&#39;s shrimp paste and mix it with some molasses. Adjust to your preference."
