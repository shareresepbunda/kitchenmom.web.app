recipeingredient:
- " For the dough"
- "1/2 cup milk"
- "1 1/4 tsp yeast"
- "1 orange"
- "3 tbsp butter room temperature"
- "1 egg room temperature"
- "1/4 cup sugar"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "2 cups allpurpose flour"
- " For the filling"
- "1/2 cup brown sugar"
- "4 tbsp butter room temperature"
- "1/2 tsp five spice"
- "1 tsp cardamom"
- "1 tsp cinnamon"
- "1 1/2 tbsp orange juice"
- " For the glaze"
- "1/3 cup powdered sugar"
- "1 tbsp orange juice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the milk to 115 degrees F. Sprinkle the yeast on top and let stand for at least 5 minutes, until you see bubbles."
- "Grate the zest from the orange. Add the zest, butter, egg, sugar, and salt to the yeast mixture. Stir to combine."
- "Stir in the flour, 1 cup at a time, until the dough comes together."
- "Knead the dough for 5 minutes. It will become less sticky but still be very sticky. Resist the urge to add more flour."
- "Butter a large bowl. Scrape all the dough off the counter and into the bowl. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 30-45 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, mix all the filling ingredients together until thoroughly combined."
- "Tip the risen dough out onto a well-floured work surface, and generously sprinkle the dough with more flour. Roll out the dough into a rectangle, about 16 inches by 12 inches (size not exact!)."
- "Dollop the filling over the dough and then spread it into a thin, even layer."
- "Starting at a long edge, use a dough scraper or metal spatula to help you roll up the dough into a log."
- "Generously butter a 12 inch pie dish (or another baking pan approximately that size)."
- "Cut the log into 8 equal pieces. Arrange them in the pie pan so you can see the spiral of filling, one roll in the middle and the rest in a circle around it."
- "Brush the rolls with warm milk so they don’t dry out. Let rise in a warm place for about 20 minutes."
- "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F."
- "Bake the rolls for 20-22 minutes. If they look very brown after 18 minutes, put foil on top to prevent further browning."
- "While the rolls are cooling, make the glaze by beating the powdered sugar and orange juice together until no lumps remain."
- "When the rolls have cooled for at least 20 minutes, drizzle the glaze on top. (The longer you wait before glazing, the less the rolls will absorb the glaze.)"
